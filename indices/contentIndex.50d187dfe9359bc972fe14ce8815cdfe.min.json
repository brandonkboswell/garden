Has that analog scratch, it's not quite as visceral as my Baron Fig Confidant with the Ohto Flash Dry, but it definitely gives that sensation\n  * More importantly, I can write notes on it from the bed without getting up.\n* Size and weight it great. It's very very thin and I can hold it in one hand with no problems. I find it much easier to hold in one hand than my iPad Pro 11in.\n* Can run most *Android* apps\n* Backlight is good and supports warm light. It works really well also if you have overhead lighting in your office and the light on your desk isn't perfect. The sensation of backlit paper is pretty cool I must say. *(By default it doesn't come back on when you wake the device from sleep which seems like a weird default, but it's easily fixed in the preferences.)*\n* Great support for Left-handed people\n* Turned off all notifications and it has been distraction free.\n* Notes can be fullscreen and UI free if you have a pen with an eraser button, without an eraser button I found myself needing to go into the UI for that all of the time. \n* Feels faster than the [Kindle Oasis](Kindle.md), especially when typing\n* The built into handwriting to type is surprisingly good. I very rarely use the onscreen keyboard\n* If you export your notes they are vector and are nice and sharp no concerns there. \n\n### Cons\n\n* Expensive at $509 USD\n* App Optimizations out of the box are hit or miss\n  * Initially when I got the device I didn't think it was going to work because the legibility in the [Kindle](Kindle.md) app was very bad. It looked like when you send a low PPI image to a typesetter with anti-aliasing turned off. Later I learned I can turn the optimization off and it looks close to the same quality as my [Kindle](Kindle.md) Oasis, but significantly bigger\n* I wish it came out of the box in a more opinionated fashion. You can get it to be exactly what you want, but you might have to flip a few setting switches. It just seems silly because they took the time to give you all the right options, just didn't turn them on by default. \n* The [Kindle](Kindle.md) app is not quite as sharp as my [Kindle](Kindle.md) Oasis, but it's close enough\n* They should have made the side of the device that the pen sits on flat so that the pen stays put. Both the Boox Pen and the S-Pen don't stay put. \n* Page turning in the notes app could be faster. \n* The UI takes some getting used to, but after a week of use I feel like I can get around really well.\n* I wish I could double tap to undo like I did in *GoodNotes*. Instead I use the eraser.\n\n### If you are considering purchasing this item, please use my [link](https://amzn.to/3LAnVTv) as it helps support this site.

The answer is the Wacom Felt if your stylus supports it. ;) The second is how do I integrate my eInk tablet notes into my PKM system. Today let's dig into that topic and I will show you the easiest ways to integrate with [PKM](moc/Personal%20Knowledge%20Management.md) systems on the *Supernote*, *Boox* \u0026 [reMarkable](reMarkable%202.md).\n\nLet's first talk about why you want to get your handwritten notes into your PKM system. I typically use my tablet as a place to sketch ideas, orient my thoughts or outline a rough draft, but I usually think of it as a throw away step towards getting the ball rolling. It's a rough non-linear outline or sketch for my conscious self to better understand my thoughts or to unpack the problem or question at hand. With that said, sometimes I like what comes out and I think it has merit in sharing with others on my team or to my future self I will package it up and get that content into my PKM system. \n\n* From there you can add the image, all the systems can do this.\n* and some can export the handwriting\n\nThis all comes down to workflow. Which device has a workflow that you could see yourself doing to get your notes off of the tablet and into a long-term home.\n\n## Supernote\n\n* Exporting Images / PDFs, but when it comes to converting to handwriting it's a bit limited\n* For getting PDFs / Images off the device, the Supernote Cloud is the best option I have found for this, but it could definitely be improved. \n\n## Boox Note Air 2 Plus\n\n* Supports handwriting conversion, but it can be a bit slow and this can be a bit of a nuisance. This is my biggest gripe with the Boox where it doesn't do enough work in the background to keep the experience fast and hitch free. \n\n## reMarkable 2\n\n* Supports exporting via the reMarkable App\n* Supports Handwriting to text on device\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhere I feel [eInk Digital Tablets](moc/eInk%20Digital%20Tablets.md) shine are as thinking devices (tools for thought if you will), they should be where you get the ideas out of your head that will inform a more polished final draft. If those ideas are robust and of high quality, there are ways to get those onto a typed page, but if your goal is perfectly typed meeting notes, I recommend you just type those from the beginning.\n\n### Behind the Scenes\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.460911487-04:00","tags":null},"/EHR-Core-Values":{"title":"EHR Core Values","content":"\n*EHR*\n\n* The original goals behind EHRs were to make *claims* flow more efficiently and I would argue that in many ways they are doing that.\n  * Our goal when set out to build [Dorsata](Dorsata.md) was to build the missing specialty specific *clinical layer* and top of the existing EHR.

If I'm being honest my wife used to give me hell that I ran a mini-Radio Shack out of our house where I would sell my out of favor keyboards and mice to my friends who were in search for gaming peripherals. For the past few years I've used a Drop Alt Signature Series Space Race as my keyboard of choice. When Lofree reached out to me and asked if I wanted to try out their low profile gasket mount keyboard, I didn't expect much, I figured I've never used a keyboard like that, so why not, but man, has it really surprised me. Let's talk about it. \n\n### INTRO\n\nI've been watching a bunch of Peter Pee's Sonos videos on YouTube and if you haven't checked out Peter's videos you should, I will have a link down in the description. Peter does a really unique thing where he starts his videos with the conclusion so if you're busy you get the core information with none of the fluff, and then he gives more detail afterwards for those who want that extra detail. I'm going to give that a try in this video, so let me know your thoughts down in the comments.\n\nLet me first start by saying that this video is not sponsored by Lofree. They did send me this keyboard for review, but that doesn't have any impact on this review. With that out of the way: I've been using the Lofree Flow for a little over two weeks now and I'm really impressed with it. It's by no means perfect, we'll get into my nitpicks a little bit later, but this keyboard has replaced my Drop Alt Space Race I haven't missed the Space Race one bit. \n\n### A bit of history (Likely use the opening bit from the unboxing, it was actually pretty good)\n\nBefore we talk specifics about the Lofree it probably makes sense to spend a few moments talking about my keyboard journey up to this point, so that you can get a feel for my level of experience with keyboards. I find that keyboard nerdery is a wide spectrum and you should probably asses where I fall in this spectrum so you can figure out what to trust and what to be skeptical of. You might have different standards than I do, both higher and lower. \n\nMy first foray into mechanical keyboards was a Corsair Strafe which I don't have anymore. It was a full size gaming keyboard with a full numpad and Cherry MX red switches, but I quickly realized that it was way to big for the small desk I used then as I would often run into it with my mouse while playing shooters. Next up was the Logitech G Pro keyboard. Which is a TKL layout keyboard that had good feeling key travel and was cleaner looking than the Corsair, but it was still too big and I wanted to try something in the 60% size. So I grabbed Anne Pro 2.\n\n### Unboxing from the original\n\n\\\u003cWe might end up cutting some of this if it gets too long, but I think it's probably worth showing some of the packaging. \u003e\n\n*\\\u003cFast Forward 2+ weeks\u003e*\n\n### Typing Feel\n\nWhat it ultimately comes down to is I really enjoy the typing feel on the Lofree Flow. It's a smaller key-throw than a typical MX switch, but it's still a sizeable key throw. \n\n### Look \u0026 Feel\n\n### Build Quality\n\nThe build quality is definitely a bit lower than my $300 Drop Space race, but I think you can fault the keyboard too much for that, it's in a different price point\n\\* For instance the metal feels a little on the thin side and I can feel it flex a little bit here at the bottom of the keyboard, especially when I squeeze it\n\\* When I first got my keyboard the gasket base was slide ever so slightly to the left and you could feel the left shift key brush slightly against the side of the keyboard.\n\\* A few days later, I realized I could shift the gasket by pushing it over ever so slightly. Now it's perfectly centered and it hasn't moved a bit. My guess is that mine got dropped in shipping. \n\n### BlueTooth\n\n* I'm not sure why it has a three-way switch for power. Maybe someone can explain this to me down in the comments. There is off, which is self-explanatory, on which is designed for being used over USB and the Bluetooth mode which enables the BlueTooth Radio. \n\n### Customizability\n\n* No QMK\n* There is no software component on this keyboard\n* You get the effects that ship on the keyboard and that it is\n\n* The switches are hot-swappable, but they're a non-standard switch and as of yet only hot-swappable with the one other Kaihl Low Profile POM switch.\n  * So if you buy the linear you could hot-swap to the tactile or vice versa. \n  * but that's not a big shame because these switches are where the keyboard shines\n  * They have a shorter key-throw than a normal MX switch, but it's still plenty long to be responsive, clear \n\n### Pricing bit. Maybe drop this:\n\nWhat's even crazier is this keyboard is a fraction of the price of that keyboard.  The Space Race when I bought it was $300. *Again, it was a splurge, but it was about the same price as buying all the parts individually and I didn't have to do any group buys and solder anything.* If I'm not mistaken, Lofree plans to sell this keyboard for $149 on Kickstarter and I think they have it for $109 during the pre-order period. \n\n### Outro\n\nThanks for sticking around. If you're interested in picking up the Lofree Flow, please use my link down in the comments as it helps support the channel. Other ways you can help support the channel are by liking and sharing this video. I'm curious, what are your thoughts on the Lofree Flow? Also, this was my first formal keyboard review. What should I do differently in future reviews? Let me know those down in the comments as well. Thanks again for watching and until next time have a great day.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.379249272-04:00","tags":null},"/Loftie":{"title":"Loftie","content":"\n*2022-05-09*\nThere has been a weird phenomenon since I got the Loftie.

I grew up in a very small town and we only had dial up internet, but I had an excellent communications teacher, Tracy Wainwright who taught English, Yearbook, Advanced Comm (Morning News) and Newspaper. I wasn't a fan of English, but I loved Yearbook and Advanced Comm. It was in her Yearbook class that I began using Adobe *Photoshop*, *InDesign* \u0026 *Illustrator*. \n* I got pretty decent in those and started creating my own form of awful high school digital art and told my Mom and I wanted to go to art school. She talked me out if it and convinced me to go to business school for *Marketing*. Effectively the same field but from the opposite end of the table. \n* While in college I worked in a local print shop and that was where I actually got good with the Adobe suite. One of our largest customers at the print shop was Virginia Women's Center, the main OBGYN group in Richmond. They would constantly order business cards and all of the cards followed a standard template. \n* The marketing lead would send us the information for the business card and we would update the business card and send them a proof. They would approve it and then we would print it. \n* I found myself spending so much time just doing this process, so I decided I would see if I could automate this. This was my path to engineering. \n* I wrote a web application where they could add their employee roster and the information for the business card and a script in InDesign that could talk to that API ingest that information to XML and apply that XML to the template. \n* Fast forward a few years. I finish my *MBA*...\n* After finishing my Master's program, I moved from Richmond, VA to DC to be involved in the startup scene. I was involved in a startup at the 1776 Incubator in DC. That's how I met David Fairbrothers, [Dorsata](Dorsata.md) CEO. One evening when my first startup was coming to a close I had David show me what he and Greg Herrington were planning for [Dorsata](Dorsata.md). \n* We saw all of these exciting apps being built for consumer use cases, but healthcare was not part of this. Why could we have these highly polished workflows for posting what we ate for dinner, but Doctors are forced to use what is essentially a Microsoft Access Database for managing the care of 1000's of people. It just seemed so backwards.

Record in a small, quiet room\n\nRecord in the smallest and quietest room possible to reduce outside noise and echoes. Shut windows and doors, turn off noise-making machines or devices, and put pets out of the room. Fill your recording space with soft items (couches, pillows, carpet, etc.) to muffle any errant noises. \n\n2. Keep your body still\n\nMoving your body around creates background noise while recording. This happens a lot if you use earbud headphones. The wire lays close to your chest which causes the microphone to rub against your shirt and collar. Try to stay still in your chair with your feet planted. Avoid moving things around on your desk.\n\n#### Speech\n\n3. Be yourself\n\nYou’re here because we already know you’re a great human and speaker! Don’t worry about “likes” or “ums.” Using filler language like “uhhhh” or “y’know?” is a sign that you’re speaking casually. Try not to keep track of your “like” count.\n\n4. Signal Non-verbally\n\nIn a regular conversation, we can see smiles, frowns, fidgets, and more. That’s hard to do in a podcast! Smiling makes you sound friendly. Vary your vocal inflection. If you are trying to convey a particular emotion — genuine interest! shock! delight! — it really helps.\n\n5. Don’t be afraid to re-do\n\nIf you feel you were unclear, misspoke, or would just like a re-do, you can always say “let me try that again”. You can also always flag it audibly for our editor “Hey Editor, please don’t include that!” either after you’ve said it, or the end of the recording. Your privacy matters.\n\n#### Style\n\n6. Stay aware of time  \n   Given that Moss \u0026 Friends is a 30 minute podcast, consider which stories should take priority, and keep the rest concise.\n\n6.

I've tested the [Boox Note Air 2 Plus](Boox%20Note%20Air%202%20Plus.md), the [reMarkable 2](reMarkable%202.md) and now the [SuperNote A5 X](Supernote%20A5%20X.md). In this article I will tell you about the [SuperNote A5 X](Supernote%20A5%20X.md), how it stacks up against the competitors and who is and isn't a good fit for this device. \n\n## Initial Impressions and Build Quality\n\n* Durability shouldn't be an issue. The fact that it is plastic and flexible means I'm not worried about it. The [Boox](Boox%20Note%20Air%202%20Plus.md) and the [reMarkable 2](reMarkable%202.md) I feel like I need to bring a sleeve in order to not be afraid of breaking them. If I was on the go a ton, this would be my preferred tablet to carry.\n* The Supernote is nearly twice as thick as the reMarkable. About the thickness of a single subject notebook, which as a lefty are not particularly fond memories of writing on real paper.\n* I wish the screen were brighter. The fact that it is missing a backlight is one thing, but combined with a low whitepoint screen makes it feel even darker.\n* The Heart of Metal pen is great. It has great feel and weight. Its the perfect thickness for me. Feels very premium. The lack of eraser is no big deal on the Supernote because of the two finger erase gesture. Every other tablet should add this feature, it is a game changer.\n* I love how thin the folio is. It feels like it protects but doesn't affect the form factor of the device\n* I wish the folio attached to the device in two places. I sometimes accidentally pick up in between the device and the folio.\n* I love that flipping open the folio unlocks the device. It feels snappy and I love it.\n\n## Writing Feel\n\n* I don't love the feel of writing on the screen, but I think that is very much a personal preference thing and that many people will.\n* The screen is very smooth and I find that I prefer the more vellum feel of the Boox and reMarkable\n* I have to not press as hard as I normally would or the pen tip will dig into the screen. It doesn't do any damage it just affects the writing feel. This is probably what a thick pad of paper would do as well. \n* The look of your writing after the fact doesn't look as good as the Boox, but it does have anti-aliasing unlike the reMarkable 2\n* I find that I prefer the ballpoint pen over the fine-liner and its very similar to the reMarkable in that regard. It's interesting, because I do like fineliners in real life, but apparently not digitally.\n* The best nibs for the Boox / reMarkable will not feel like the best nibs for the Supernote. The screens are too different\n\n## Software\n\n* They have the prettiest toolbar of the 3 main eInk tablets. \n* I love that I can move the toolbar to the bottom, this is a huge deal for lefties like me who curl their hands as they write. This allows me to use the tablet without hitting the buttons at the top of the screen. This is an issue I've had with both the Supernote and the reMarkable.\n* I like that you can set it s page turns only occur when using two fingers, but I will say I still encounter accidental page flips from my palm.\n* The icons and tools are so intuitive, I love that I get one of each tool at the root of the toolbar. It has the right tools so I don't even feel the need to customize it.\n* I love the new header with the title and page number. It's obvious to me what notebook I'm in, while also not distracting me from my notes.\n* I love that the tool state is shared across documents. It means I can create a fresh document and not waste a bunch of time setting my pen settings.\n\n* In just the 6 weeks I've had the SuperNote A5 X the software has improved significantly. I was able to join Ratta's beta program and got a version of the software that worked much better for me as a lefty. That Beta patch that I was running has since been made public. \n\n## Organization / Navigation\n\n* Being able to pin pages and documents to the quick access menu is awesome.\n* The star feature and titles are really awesome and allow you to have long lived documents like notebooks but still be able to find things.\n* The fact that new notes are autonamed with today's date is a nice touch. Way to go Supernote.\n* Page flips are incredibly fast and make the Boox note experience feel slow.\n* The reMarkable 2 can get close to the navigation quality of the Supernote with hacks, but if you are not going to take the time to hack it then the Supernote is far superior.\n\n## Wish List\n\n* I wish you could set the thickness of the highlighter similar to how you can with the other pens? I have a consistent line-height that I write with and would be useful to be able to set the highlight to that line-height.\n\n* I wish you could switch tools with a gesture like in DDVK's hack on the reMarkable. This would enable me to run the tablet without any GUI and still be able to easily switch between the pen and the highlighter.\n* I wish the export was actually vector based instead of being a live trace of a raster image (or at least that is what it appears like).\n* I wish I could export documents to *Google Drive*\n* I wish the PDF highlighter worked more like the one on the reMarkable their highlighter is awesome.\n* I wish I can check or uncheck whether I want the template/grid when exporting.\n* I wish I could send tasks to [Todoist](Todoist.md), like I do on the Boox device. I manage one central task inbox and I wish this could feed into it. \n\n## Who is this tablet good for? (Who should buy this)\n\n* The person who carries a daily journal / planner. This is the eInk device that feels the most like writing on a pad of paper or journal. People who maintain paper todo lists / day plans will also love this device.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.492638158-04:00","tags":null},"/SurfingKeys":{"title":"SurfingKeys","content":"\nTried out on *2022-04-29*, but it seemed too complicated and not a big enough upgrade over [Vimium](Vimium.md) to warrant relearning a bunch of muscle memory.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.244104156-04:00","tags":null},"/Suzuki-Method":{"title":"Suzuki Method","content":"\n### Strategy for teaching / learning *Piano*\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.30971393-04:00","tags":null},"/Swift-Development":{"title":"Swift Development","content":"\n\n \u003e \n \u003e Let me start by saying, I am not a Swift developer.

It basically became my inbox for everything: Tasks, Ideas, Funny things that people said that I didn't want to instantly forget. I came to the realization that as long as I could get the item into TickTick I would act on it. \n\nThe issue I found was although TickTick has good quick capture and dictation built in, there was no way they could do it fast enough for what I wanted. Mostly because of limitations in iOS. At least on my iPhone XS it can only boot so fast and it only can be ready for input so fast. \n\nSo I set out to see if I could create a quick capture that was instantly ready for input and that I could easily dictate to while in the shower or driving in the car. \n\nHere's where I landed:\n\n* Tap Quick Capture: to type in a quick task\n* I could tap the same for Dictate\n* If I'm in another app and realize there's something I need to do late I can double tap the back of my phone to open the quick capture.\n* Lastly if I'm in driving in the car or get an idea while in the shower I can say Hey Siri, Jot\n\nAlright so let me show you how to set this up:\nQuick Capture \n\nThe Dictation Workflow \n\n* New Shortcut\n* Choose a New: In this case Jot this Down\n* Choose Add Action\n  * Search for Dictate Text\n* Search for TickTick\n  * Choose Add Single Task and Choose Dictated Text\n  * Spin open the Options Arrow and be sure to Enable Edit in App. An interesting issue with Shortcut workflows is they don't open the app and the apps don't get a chance to send your newly created item to the cloud which means your newly created item only exists on your device which is exactly what we don't want. If you choose Edit in App then TickTick will open and your item will be available anywhere you access TickTick.\n  * From here you can hit the share button at the bottom and choose Add to Home Screen\n    * You can change the icon by tapping here on the left and you can change the App name here on the right. Choose add and you've got a Quick Capture App you can launch from the Home Screen\n\nAlright on to the Quick Capture Workflow:\n\n* Same initial steps as before \n  * New Shortcut\n  * Name it \n  * Choose Add Action\n    * Search for TickTick\n    * Add a Single Task\n      * Tap where it says task and choose Ask Each Time. Press Done on your keyboard\n      * Spin open the arrow and enable edit in App\n    * Lets give it a spin.\n    * If it asks would you like to Allow Your shortcut to share data with TickTick then choose Allow\n    * To make it launch on Double tapping the back of your phone:\n      * Go to settings -\u003e Accessibility -\u003e Touch -\u003e Back Tap -\u003e. Double Tap  and choose your Shortcut from the bottom of the list.\n      * Now Double tapping the back of your iPhone will launch your quick capture shortcut.\n\n* There you have it. That's how I quick capture and dictate with TickTick for iOS. If this was helpful to you please leave a like and comment. Also I have a video on how I use Alfred to Quick launch anything.

As a creative (or anyone who likes to solve tough problems), *flow state* is where you make progress. I sometimes call this *Progress Time*. Everything else you do is to keep the lights on, and to improve the chances that you find yourself in flow state.\n\n## Factors effecting flow state:\n\n* getting good sleep the night before\n* have my to-dos for the day in order so that they aren't nagging at me\n* know that I have a block of time allotted where I'm not going to accidentally miss my next meeting\n* Coffee (not too much)\n* Noise cancelling headphones (even if nothing is playing), there is something about separating myself from my surroundings that is especially helpful.\n  * The [AirPods Pro](../AirPods%20Pro.md) are amazing for this because they are lightweight, non-fatiguing and have no cable to get wrapped up in.\n\n## My Setup\n\nFor me, the most reliable way to achieve *flow state* is to throw in the [AirPods Pro](https://amzn.to/3yJY1HU) headphones and set them to *Noise Cancellation* and turn on one of the following:\n\n* [Journaling (No Lyrics) on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Vy94FDF0S5A4FTvKnTWtL?si=279657fa9f034359)\n* [Calm Vibes on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX1s9knjP51Oa?si=bdbae497376f4858)\n* [SKRILLEX LIVE @ ULTRA MUSIC FESTIVAL 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2VmcuOEqEg)\n\nI have much higher quality headphones than the Airpods, but some combination of the noise cancellation, weightlessness, and the lack of a cable makes a huge difference in helping me focus on what I need to get done. I do find it odd that I can either listen to calm, quiet music or aggressive dubstep and they both enable the same thing, but they do. I find listening to unfamiliar music with forward lyrics difficult for *concentration*. The noise cancellation is also helpful because I find the constant fan noise of the [Touchbar Macbook Pro](../Touchbar%20Macbook%20Pro.md) especially annoying. \n\nFor listening to music for enjoyment, I prefer the [Hifiman Sundara](https://amzn.to/3P22hYr) headphones. \n*Use music without lyrics to help achieve flow state*\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.131505233-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Heirloom-Grade":{"title":"Heirloom Grade","content":"\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \"When you buy something cheap and bad, the best you’re going to feel about it is when you buy it.

You start from scratch, there are 1000's of plugins to chose from, and honestly it all becomes one big distraction from actually generating thoughts and ideas. In this video, I will share my approach to managing an [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) vault in hopes it will save you a few headaches when starting from scratch. \n\n**Note:** I publish my [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) Vault using *Github Pages* and because of this I use more folders than most vaults you will see. Having folders that I can hide away makes making sure I only share what I intend to share with the Internet. If you haven't already go check out my vault at brandonkboswell.com. I will put a link in the description.\n\n## Folders / Major Areas\n\n* 1-1\n  * *I thoroughly enjoy writing in Obsidian, so I put my 1-1 notes with people I chat with on a regular basis instead of putting them in another app*\n  * It's just a running log with a date and the todos associated with that session\n* Business\n  * A random assortment of notes that I want to keep and link to, but I don't want shared with the world.\n* Collections\n  * Where I collect items I thought were interesting that I want to be able to refer back to, but I might not actually have significant commentary on. Please let me know how you do this in the comments, that way I do this is not ideal. Basically I screenshot or get the URL for whatever it is and then Quick Add to [TickTick](../TickTick.md) and then when I clean out my [TickTick](../TickTick.md) Inbox I put it into [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) for storage.\n* Cooking\n  * My wife is a far better cook then I, but I do cook a few meals each week. The issue I always found was I would do a meal and then by the time I cook that meal the next time I couldn't remember what I had tried, so I end up making the same mistakes and not progressing at perfecting the dish. So I started creating cooking notes for these and after each time I cook a dish I put another entry into that note. When I go to start cooking that dish again I refer back to what I had written the last time on what to try next. \n* Ideas\n  * A random assortment of ideas. These are mostly a folder just to make them private when publishing\n* People\n  * My notes on people.

Your ideas have value, but tend to arrive when you least expect them. By making it a habit to “capture” and save them, you can allow them to live forever in a trusted system that reflects your goals and interests. This also leaves your mind free and clear to come up with even more ideas. \n\n## — Thiago Forte\n\n---\n\n### Quick Capture\n\nI get ideas \u0026 inspiration often while working on others and TickTick's quick capture allows me to quickly jot that down and get back to what I was doing without missing a beat.\n\\* From iOS\n\\* From MacOS\n\\* From Chrome\n\n### The Inbox\n\nMy digital note list. This is where I cull through all the things \u0026 set follow up timing and lists for. \n\nReference Seth Godin's work around a system over outcomes. You have control over showing up, you have less control over the outcome, but if you create a system where you produce consistently and are constantly working on improving, you will be doing what you can.\n\n### My Lists\n\n* What are they:\n  * Strategic Work vs Junk Work\n  * Routines\n  * Home\n  * Evening\n  * Personal Development\n  * Youtube\n    * Youtube Channel\n    * Youtube Video Ideas\n  * Productivity Blog\n  * Reviews\n  * Family\n  * Store\n  * Content Backlog\n  * Ideas\n\n### Routines\n\nPrior to embracing a digital todo list, I was a very reactionary person. Things didn't get done until I noticed they were needed. For example in my twenties I wouldn't go and get a haircut until I realized that my hair was way too long. In my mid twenties I finally realized the value of pre-scheduling haircuts and how I didn't have to look like a bum between haircuts. \nOnce I figured this out I could apply this same pattern to other things in life. Cutting the dog's nails, changing air filters in the house, getting the car inspected, etc.\nSetting up repeats when creating routines. \n\n### Calendar View / Time Blocking\n\n* How I do my timeblocking and make sure that my plan for the day makes sense. In a perfect world I would review this each night in preparation for the next day, but I typically review this with my morning cup of coffee before work. \n* Time blocking, including thinking time. Articles. Anything I want to get done. There is a much greater chance that you will follow through on your thinking time if you put it on a calendar. I used to do this in Fantastical, but I found that if I had to move that time for whatever reason (it happened a lot) that I would get phantom notifications and it quickly got the point that I was hating *Fantastical*. I worked with their support team, but ultimately it sounds like a limitation in how their push notification implementation with iOS and it wasn't fixable. So I solved this by moving my [Timeblocking](../Timeblocking.md) to TickTick as it could represent my Google Calendars similarly to Fantastical. (It does have a less than desirable quirk where declined meetings will continue to show). TickTick I've reported this (please fix it).\n\n---\n\n### Pros\n\n* Has Calendar Support that Things 3 was (intentionally) missing which made timeboxing and aligning with meeting schedules challenging\n* Really good support for attachments \n  (this was legitimately the thing that made me leave Things 3)\n* Syncing between multiple devices\n  * Native + Web\n* Excellent Quick Capture\n* Foldered Lists are pretty useful\n* Free Tier will likely work for many people\n\n---\n\n### Cons\n\n* Template support exists, but is a bit clunky\n* Invites you decline still show up in TickTick. This is especially painful for weekly recurring meetings. (Fix this TickTick)\n* You can't move calendar events the way you can tasks, so you still need to use another calendar app such as Fantastical or Google Cal\n* Calendar view is more readable in the Browser than on the Mac App\n  * The difference used to be huge, now it's just minor.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:25.907784356-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/How-to-Create-Templates-for-the-Boox-Note-Air-2-Plus":{"title":"How to Create Templates for the Boox Note Air 2 Plus","content":"\n1.

I'm not going to get into everything that's magical about Alfred because I could ramble way too long about that. Today let's focus on one particular trick for Alfred which is Bookmarks. \n\nI use [Alfred](../Alfred.md) to open Applications all of the time by tapping Option + Space and typing the application I am looking for, but more and more often the applications I use each day are in my web browser, especially the ones that I work on and have to administer. \nOften times there are unique URLs for pages I use, but maybe only once or twice a month. \n\nWherever possible I want to remove looking from things from my workflow and instead I want to be able to find and launch those things as quickly as I can think of them.

If you add a new bookmark just hit Option + Space to open Alfred and then press escape and by the time you open it the next time your newly added bookmark will be there. \n\nEver since I learned this trick, I feel like I can now get to all the places on my Mac that I want as soon as I think of them.

Instead of me managing my windows manually, what if they could manage themselves.\n* I liked the idea of this, but found it to be a bit unreliable in the [MacOS](../MacOS.md) Monterrey Beta which I was running, and started trying to troubleshoot it. I found that *BetterTouchTool* and it were having weird interactions, and once I stopped using *BetterTouchTool* it worked better. \n* While trying to troubleshoot Yabai, I came across Christopher Kapic's Video on Yabai and he mentioned [Amethyst](../Amethyst.md). I dug into it and gave it a shot and it seemed to match my needs pretty well. \n* Here are the shortcuts I use (Note I use a hyper key caps locks that is bound to Escape on tap and changes my HJKL keys into arrow keys).

Along the way, I will show you 5 tips to have a healthy balance with your phone\n\nMany videos talk about decluttering your phone, and I am in favor of this, but ultimately for a different reason. Everything in your life is vying for your attention, and your phone likely most of all. A big point of emphasis with my iPhone is making it as much of a distraction free tool as it can be. For that reason, aside from the dock, my Home Screen only has 6 apps on it. \n\nShow's the *iPhone* on Screen w/ the Dock illuminated. There's nothing too crazy on the dock\n\n## 1. Out of sight, out of mind — Intentionality\n\nI am a big proponent of out of sight, out of mind. My goal is to have intention when I pick up my *iPhone*. I don't uninstall distracting apps from my phone, I just make it where my brain has to have intention to open that app. If I want to open Reddit, I'm going to search for it. I introduce just that little bit of friction so that I won't get pulled into an addictive open just because I unlocked my phone. \n\n## 2. Add a little friction\n\nFor some apps, hiding the icon on your home screen may not be enough, the ones I have to watch out for are [Twitter](../Twitter.md) and *Reddit*. For those apps, you might want to check out [One Sec](../One%20Sec.md). It's an app you install on your iPhone and with a little setup it will add a little friction to opening those apps that you can't quite seem to get away from. It gives you a moment to pause and think, does this app align with my goals? The other feature that [One Sec](../One%20Sec.md) has, is the ability to send you a notification if you are still in the app after a certain period of time. So if you are still using the app after say 5 minutes, it will give you a notification in hopes that it will pull you out of the Matrix. [You can get 15% off One Sec by using this link](https://apps.apple.com/redeem/?ctx=offercodes\u0026id=1532875441\u0026code=BRANDON15). Alternatively, you can use *iOS Shortcuts* to set a 5-minute timer when you open those addictive apps. That is why I have a clock on my home screen so that I can cancel that timer when I leave. If you're curious about how you can set up this shortcut for yourself, let me know down in the comments and I can put up a video on how to do that.\n\n## 3. Give yourself more rewarding distractions\n\nWe can't be distraction free all the time, and for that I put some good distractions at arms reach, if I just need a break from what I'm doing. For me, this is [Readwise](../Readwise.md) and their new RSS+Read-it-later app [Readwise Reader](../Readwise%20Reader.md). So if I just need a break instead of getting pulled into the infinity pool which is Twitter, I can review some key highlights from books or articles I've read, or read an article I have saved for later. It is like putting healthy snacks out in case you get hungry. \n\n## 4. Turn off notifications\n\nI shouldn't have to say this, but for those 9 people out there who still have notifications enabled on their iPhone, please go turn them off. This is the equivalent of signing yourself up for spam phone calls in the modern age. The only real exception I have to this rule is my car and my front doorbell. Aside from that, my notifications are off. While we're on the topic of notifications, I highly recommend that you enable iOS's new * Focus Mode* feature. It lets you filter out messages, phone calls and notifications so that you only get important ones while enabled. I have this set up to turn on automatically at 9am when I start my workday. It then runs until noon, turns off for an hour for lunch and then comes back from 1pm to 5pm. \n\n## 5. Avoid using your phone during high productivity periods\n\nFor me, that's in the morning before work. I have an hour or so that I can do something meaningful with before the workday starts, but if I reach for my iPhone that hour is likely gone. For that reason, I no longer us my iPhone as an alarm clock. I recently bought the [Loftie](../Loftie.md) alarm clock and it has given me my mornings back by not having my iPhone be the first thing I'm greeted with in the morning. It allows you to avoid the news and twitter and set the tone you want for your day. \n\n## 6. Make your phone less desirable at rest\n\nThis goes back to the your phone is a magnet for your attention. If you put a picture of your partner or your child on lock screen of your phone you are just pulling yourself back into. Its going to suck you back in and drain your willpower. For me I set my background to a black image. That does two things, it makes it less likely I'm going to get pulled in and it saves me some battery. As long as you have an iPhone with an *OLED* screen you save battery by having a black background image because the pixels only have to illuminate when there is color to display. The other thing you can do is set you phone to be grayscale so that the bright colors don't pull you in. It's pretty impractical to leave it in grayscale all of the time, so I have an accessibility shortcut set up where I triple tap the lock button to toggle between grayscale and color. This lets me see the colors of a photo I just took, but not have the home screen be colored while at rest.\n\n## 7. Make the iPhone a great capture tool\n\nI'm trying out this new app *Quick Capture*. Quick gives you a quick way to jot down a quick note either by hand, photo or verbally. Think of it like *Drafts*, but it supports dictation.\n\n* Often times when I'm trying to quick capture something I want it to go into my task manager. In my case, [Akiflow](../Akiflow.md). Show the double tap to write things and triple tap to dictate.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:25.957234188-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/PSA-Backup-your-Obsidian-Vault-Via-Github":{"title":"PSA Backup your Obsidian Vault Via Github","content":"\n## Steps\n\n1.

I put a bunch of time into figuring out how all of this would work together, and I probably could have saved a bunch of time by just using Obsidian Publish. Either way, I've learned a ton in setting this up. I also have more control on what does and doesn't get published. I have a ton of private content in my vault and I do not want that being published, which is why I went to all this trouble you're about to see. Yes, I could use multiple vaults, but that seems annoying when you want to link to something that resides in another vault.\n\nSo you're thinking about publishing your [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) Vault online, but you're not sure if you want to pay for *Obsidian Publish* or not. I've been there, that was the exact same situation I was in when I considered publishing my vault. Call me cheap, but I wasn't sure if I was ready to pay $20 a month for the rest of time. Would I keep writing meaningful content, would people actually ready it? So instead, I decided I was going to figure out a way to publish my vault without the monthly fee. I now publish my vault online, and I don't pay anything for hosting. **(You are currently reading this article from the digital vault that I publish through this method)**\n\n* For me, I cobbled together a combination of:\n  * [**Quartz**](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n    * A nice, clean-looking template for your digital garden that sits on top of *Hugo*. Once you get your bearings with it, you will find that it is just a *Hugo* site and you can customize it a ton if you would like.\n  * **[Obsidian Export](https://github.com/brandonkboswell/obsidian-export/tree/title_frontmatter)** (Slightly Modified)\n    * A Rust based library for converting your Obsidian Vault to standards compliant *Markdown* that supports translating Obsidian style links to standard links that are compatible with Hugo.\n    * Quartz and Hugo both assume that all of your files have a title attribute in their frontmatter. Unfortunately, most of my files do not have this title front matter. I have a branch of obsidian-export (linked above) that uses the file's name to generate titles when that frontmatter is not present. \n  * **[obsidian-hugo](https://github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian)** \n    * *Quartz* has an easy setup that allows you to commit all of your content to *Github* and it will compile everything via *Github Actions*. This is fantastic and super helpful. The issue is I have private content that I don't want on Github.\n    * So instead I use the *obsidian-hugo* library that Quartz's Github Action uses just I use it on my local machine and precompile the filtered content before uploading to Github. This enables me to host my Digital Garden on Github (for free) without risking private content accidentally leaking out onto the internet.\n  * [**Github Pages**](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)\n    * This is where I publish the content that gets output. It's all static html and is being served by Github. There is no amount of traffic I could ever manage to generate that Github couldn't handle.\n\n### Why do I use Obsidian Export when Obsidian Hugo is required by Quartz and does most of the same things?\n\n* **obsidian-export** does a very good job of filtering out files and folders you don't want exported\n* it makes me confident that there is no chance that private data gets uploaded by not even allowing that data to be in the folder that gets parsed\n* It handles bad or no frontmatter so that the downstream pipeline doesn't have any issues\n* You can avoid a bunch of hacks to Quartz (and your layout files) by ensuring that your files have title attributes in their frontmatter. I have hacked together a fork of obsidian-export that does this automatically based on the file name when exporting. https://github.com/brandonkboswell/obsidian-export/tree/title_frontmatter\n\n# High Level Steps (these are from memory as I set this up a few months ago)\n\n1. Clone [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) into a local directory\n1. Create a Repo on Github to host your public garden\n   1. [Getting started with Github Pages](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-personal-website-with-github-pages-and-hugo-6c68592204c7)\n   1. [Configuring a Custom Domain for your Github Pages Site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)\n1. Make the public folder of your Quartz repo a submodule of that repo \n   1. `git submodule add \u003cyour_github_project_url\u003e ./public`\n1. Install Hugo for minifying and running a local server\n   1. `brew install hugo`\n1. Clone obsidian-export wherever you keep libraries\n   1. Obsidian Export runs in *Rust*, so make sure you have Rust enabled on your machine\n   1. If I remember correctly, I ran `cargo build` from the obsidian-export directory to build a local binary that can be called in the compile script\n1. Clone obsidian-hugo wherever you keep libraries\n   1. Obsidian-hugo runs in *Go*, so make sure you have Go enabled on your machine and in your PATH;\n   1. The watch/compile script will run `go run ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian -input=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/content -output=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/assets/indices -index -root=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz;` when it compiles.\n1. Update the compile and watch scripts for the paths of your folders\n   1. My quartz directory is at: ~/Sites/quartz\n   1. My Obsidian Vault is at (My *iCloud* Folder): ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/bkb\n   1. My hugo-obsidian directory is at: ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian\n1. Configure your configuration files\n   1. **Hugo Config** — quartz/config.toml file\n   1. **Quartz Config** — data/config.yaml \n   1. **Quartz Graph Config** — data/graphConfig.yaml\n1. Add a file name **.export-ignore** to your Obsidian Vault\n   1. Obsidian Export will skip any files / folders you mention here and make sure they don't get handed to Quartz\n   1. You can't create this file in Obsidian (you likely want to use the finder or a Code Editor).\n   1. A sample of my .export-ignore file is further down in this article\n1. Run the watch script (which will do an initial compile and then watch for changes to your Obsidian Vault)\n   1. Note that the compile script empties out your quartz/content directory so that files that may have been moved or deleted from your Obsidian Vault do not end up being pushed to the public internet. **Make sure that this path is set correctly before running the watch or compile script.**\n1. Start a hugo server from your quartz directory\n   1. `./serve.sh`\n1. Assuming everything worked, you should be able to preview your vault at: localhost:1313\n1. Tinker / tweak for way too long\n1. When you're ready you can commit your quartz/public directory to Github pages\n   1. **Verify *(especially for the first commit)* that there is nothing private that you don't want uploaded to the internet.**\n   1. `cd ~/Sites/quartz/public; git add .; git commit -m \"Update\"; git push origin`\n\n---\n\n## Configure your .export-ignore file at the root of your Obsidian Vault. Here's mine:\n\n````\ntemplates/*\nprivate/*\n1-1/*\nbusiness/*\ncollections/*\npeople/*\nto_publish/*\nfiles/*\ntemporal/*\npersonal/*\nscreenshots/*\nideas/*\n.trash/*\n.obsidian/*\n_content_calendar.md\n````\n\n## To compile your notes once\n\n````bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd ~/Sites/quartz; ./compile.sh\n\n--- compile.sh ---\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian; rm -fr ~/Sites/quartz/content/*; rm -rf ~/Sites/quartz/public/*; ~/Sites/obsidian-export/target/debug/obsidian-export --add-titles --frontmatter=always ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/bkb ~/Sites/quartz/content; go run ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian -input=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/content -output=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/assets/indices -index -root=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz; (cd ~/Sites/quartz \u0026\u0026 hugo --minify)\n\n````\n\n## To recompile your notes on change\n\n````bash\ncd ~/Sites/quartz; ./watch.sh\n\n--- watch.sh ---\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go; export GOROOT=\"$(/usr/local/bin/brew --prefix golang)/libexec\"; export PATH=\"$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin:${GOROOT}/bin\"; cd ~/Sites/quartz; nodemon -w ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/bkb -w ~/Sites/quartz/assets/js -w ~/Sites/quartz/assets/styles -w ~/Sites/quartz/layouts -w ~/Sites/quartz/config.toml -w ~/Sites/quartz/data/config.yaml -x \"~/Sites/quartz/compile.sh\" -e md,html,js,scss,xml\n\n````\n\n## To preview your changes before pushing to Github, you can run a local hugo server:\n\nSometimes the server will crash while the compile script is rebuilding everything. If you wrap the hugo server code in a while loop then it will restart itself if this happens. For this I will have two terminal panes open on for the watch script and one for the hugo server. As I make changes to my Obsidian Vault or the Quartz files it will recompile the content and then hugo will recompile, at which point you can refresh your browser to see the change. Usually that will be at localhost:1313.\n\n````bash\n(while true; do \n\thugo server --disableFastRender\ndone) \u0026\n````\n\n## When I'm ready to publish an update to Github:\n\nGo to the garden folder and commit those changes:\n\n````bash\ncd ~/sites/quartz/public; git add .; git commit -m \"Update\"; git push origin\n````\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n* You probably want to do your ignoring of personal files at the obsidian-export level because if a file is referenced in another file, but that file is flagged as a draft in the frontmatter then hugo-obsidian will have trouble with that and make hugo error on compile with the backlinks. Doing your ignoring of specific files in obsidian-export takes care of this.\n* If you've never used *Hugo* before (like I hadn't prior to this project), you may not know that Hugo has a static folder that generates assets you want to be in any subsequent rebuilds. When I first started this project I added a bunch of lines to the compile script to create files and moving files around when all I really needed to do was add those files to my static folder. \n* You are going to want to update your Hugo layout files to take advantage of the backlink rendering provided by Obsidian Export. The changes you'll want to make, plus an explanation are available here: https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export/issues/8#issuecomment-774521792\n\n## Previous Attempts\n\n* Originally I modified hugo-obsidian to get around the no titles issue, since I now do this in obsidian-export I no longer need to maintain a fork of that code. If it's useful to you, here is the change I made: \n  * I had to make a minor modification to obsidian-hugo because it assumes that all of your files have a title attribute in their frontmatter. Unfortunately, most of my files do not have this title front matter. I have a branch of obsidian-hugo that uses the file's name to generate titles if that frontmatter is not present. https://github.com/brandonkboswell/hugo-obsidian/tree/without_titles. \n    *As the time of this writing, that branch has not been merged into the main repo, but it may have by the time you're reading this.*\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.462291204-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Quicklaunch-your-commonly-used-applications-with-Karabiner-Elements":{"title":"Quicklaunch your commonly used applications with  Karabiner Elements","content":"\n## What shortcuts do I use?\n\n* **O Launching**\n  * Originally found it watching a YouTube Video by *Jesse Skelton* which you can find here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaJSjgVEhMQ\n    * M -\u003e Music -\u003e Spotify\n    * I -\u003e IM -\u003e Messages\n    * F -\u003e Files -\u003e Open Downloads Folder\n    * G -\u003e Google Chrome -\u003e Chrome\n    * C -\u003e Calendar -\u003e Fantastical\n    * T -\u003e TickTick -\u003e TickTick\n    * Z -\u003e Zoom -\u003e Zoom\n    * D -\u003e Obsi**d**ian -\u003e Obsidian\n    * E -\u003e Editor -\u003e Sublime Text\n    * S -\u003e Slack -\u003e Slack\n* **Hyper Key**\n  * This gives me an extra set of Keyboard Shortcut triggers without having to develop Carpel Tunnel or having to leave my home row. I used to bind many keyboard shortcuts to CTRL+ALT+COMMAND, but then I would have to leave the home row with the right hand which just leads to typing mistakes when trying to migrate back afterwards. Having the hyper key allows me to do those same shortcuts with my pinky finger on my left hand.\n    * CAPS_LOCK to HYPER (SHIFT+COMMAND+OPTION+CONTROL) or ESCAPE (If Alone)\n    * Hyper + i/j/k/l == vim directional Keys\n* **HJKL Arrow Keys**\n  * Similar to the one above. I used to have one of the old Macbook Pros with the inverted T Arrow keys, and then with the unibody Macbooks with no ports they decided to screw that up. I had a ton of muscle memory for getting to those keys and never could get that back since they changed this. So last year I decided that I was going to move my arrow keys to the home row so I wouldn't have to leave it. This configuration also has Hyper + G for beginning of line and Hyper + ; for end of line, but I honestly never use those.  I just use Hyper+Command+H or L, there's too much muscle memory there that I can't seem to give up.\n* **Shift+Escape to Tilde**\n  * This is largely just a symptom of having a 65% keyboard and needing to type a tilde where there's no key for it. This is what I chose. I have more 65% keyboard hacks in my Keyboard itself that I should probably do a video on. Let me know in the comments if you have any interest in that. \n\n[Karabiner](../Karabiner.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.379311689-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Quickly-Mark-Up-Mac-Screenshots-on-iPad-Skitch-vs-Markup":{"title":"Quickly Mark Up Mac Screenshots on iPad (Skitch vs Markup)","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.43527069-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Reflecting-on-a-year-on-YouTube":{"title":"Reflecting on a year on YouTube","content":"\nHey there, everyone.

In this video I will walk you through where they've improved, where they're the same and ultimately if I think they are worth the $250 upgrade over the AirPods you already have in your pocket. \n\n## Initial Impressions\n\n* **Quality of life Changes**\n  * Charging via *Apple Watch* charger is a nifty gimmick\n  * Charge chime\n  * Legitimate *Find My* support\n  * Battery life was already very good, it was nearly never an issue, but it is even better.\n* **Better sound quality**\n  * Old AirPods Pro were acceptable sound quality. I knew they didn't sound as good as my *Hifiman Sundara*'s but they were so damn convenient and could be open or closed back depending on my use case.\n  * The sounds quality of the new AirPods Pro are actually good. I enjoy listening to music on them.\n* **Much better Transparency + Noise Cancelling**\n  * Most importantly I work best with a sense of calm. *Noise Cancellation* is perfect for generating that [Focus](../moc/Focus.md). It is even useful when in a room that is relatively quiet.\n  * It leads to me getting pulled into fewer distractions.\n  * It creates a more intimate interaction with whatever I'm doing\n  * One of my greatest tips for achieving flow state and doing deep work\n  * Majority of the time I can't tell whether I have my headphones in or not when in transparency mode. It is that good now. \n  * The pressure people often associate with Noise Cancelling is also gone. It still gives you that isolation but without\n  * I'm that weirdo that they built Adaptive Transparency for. I used to weird the AirPods Pro (Gen 1) to concerts just in their \"Off\" mode. \n    * I recently went to a *Landmvrks* \u0026 *Miss May I* show with these and wore them the entire time. They stayed in my ears the whole time despite utter chaos and sounded great without the fatigue after the show. They probably aren't technically legitimate ear protection, but if you are one of those people who wants to hear the show and not have tinnitus, it is somewhat of a happy medium. \n* The connect speed has improved a bit, but don't expect a wholly different AirPods experience. and this is a good segue into my \n\n**Cons / Wishlist**\n\\* It still suffers from the same issue where you are listening to something on your computer and get a phone call and try to answer it on the phone and the AirPods don't want to switch to the phone. \n\\* Another use-case I have is I will be listening to something on my [Mac](../MacOS.md), pause it, grab my phone and try to make a call either by Siri or by tapping on my phone and it will try to use the handset audio instead of the AirPods. \n\\* The last one of their use cases is when you receive a call and for whatever reason your AirPods don't pick it up, but then you answer and try to switch the call to AirPods and it's an option, but takes forever to connect or it just never connects and you just sit there why the caller tries to tell you something that you're never going to hear.\n\\* Supposedly the new [MacOS](../MacOS.md) that comes out later this fall gives you full calling and handoff support, hopefully that will solve this rough spot.\n\\* I don't understand the spatial audio trend. It doesn't change or improve the headphones in any significant way, but maybe it will morph into something useful in the future. Perhaps this is all a test bed / precursor for the audio in Apple's upcoming VR/AR headsets, but as of yet it just feels like a gimmick\n\n## Conclusion\n\n* The AirPods Pro Gen 2's are a sizeable upgrade from 2019's initial AirPods Pro. If you are a daily driver of the AirPods Pro or a working professional who uses AirPods to focus, these are an easy upgrade in my book. For me personally, I use the original AirPods each day and these are an easy recommendation. If you aren't using your current AirPods Pro daily or the $250 price tag seems a little steep, then your current AirPods will continue to suffice.\n\n## Links\n\nAirPods Pro (2nd Generation) — https://amzn.to/3Ca3Z5b\nAirPods Pro (1st Generation) — https://amzn.to/3EiQIK9\nDeep Work (Cal Newport) — https://amzn.to/3D0vIHn\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.339094877-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Should-you-use-PARA-in-Obsidian":{"title":"Should you use PARA in Obsidian","content":"\nI recently read *Tiago Forte*'s [Building a Second Brain](../sources/Building%20a%20Second%20Brain.md) and I think that book has a good explanation of the *PARA* method and the *CODE Method*, but should you be using PARA in your [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) vault?\n\nI think the *PARA* system is good and has merit, but no I don't think it is a great fit for [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) or your modern graph [PKM](../moc/Personal%20Knowledge%20Management.md) systems because it is not flat enough. A file can only be in one folder and I think that makes sense in a traditional file system, but one of the benefits of [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) is that the structure of your files emerges through the references and use of that note via your graph database. To force a traditional folder structure here is limiting the benefits of that system and creating unnecessary effort in maintenance by moving files from folder to folder. \n\nOne thing I do use from the *PARA* method is having a projects folder and enumerating those at the top of [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md). This helps me to keep focus on what I should be working on instead of meandering around my garden. Don't get me wrong, I still do plenty of that, but I'm working to have a bit more intention when I'm in the garden.\n\nI could see tagging or backlinking your areas so that you could produce a dashboard or dataview of them, but I have operationalized my Areas via my task manager, in this case [Akiflow](../Akiflow.md), as that's where I'm going to make sure I meet my expected standard there. \n\nIn my opinion, everything in your garden is a resource, so no need for a folder for that. \n\nFor me, I avoid the archive in hopes of repurposing any of these project notes as a document in my public garden, but I could see if you are a major user of fleeting notes putting those into an archive.\n\nSo I've mentioned that I don't think *PARA* is a perfect fit for [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md), but that doesn't mean that it is not useful. It has been amazing in organizing my *Google Drive*, I recently consolidated and organized all of my local documents and cloud files and I feel very good about *PARA* for this.\n\nI also use the *Arc browser* and that also lends itself very nicely to the use of *PARA*. I have contexts for my different environments (Personal, Work, [moc/YouTube](../moc/YouTube.md)) and projects for each. I can see Areas and Resources working here. If you would like to see more about the *Arc browser* and how I use it, let me know down in the comments.\n\nIf you've implemented *PARA* in your life, I would love to hear about your experience and what has worked and what hasn't.

I really like the idea of VIM. The ability to move around the page completely with your keyboard is right up my alley. So much so that I use [Vimium](../Vimium.md) within Chrome. The ability to find and jump to any element on the page or click on any button with a few keystrokes is amazing. If you're interested in that, I have a video all about [Vimium](../Vimium.md). The issue is that every app you use has to support VIM movements to make the payoff worthwhile. There are tools like *kindaVim* that try to bring a VIM experience to MacOS, but it still doesn't feel fully baked. We're most of the way there, but you can't use VIM commands in URL fields or to navigate within Electron apps and it's just too painful to have these superpowers and to only be able to use them 80% of the time. Not to mention, I worry a bit about betting my entire ability to work my computer on one app that intends to be paid. It seems like a great way to get held ransom in the future.\n\nI'm sure at this point you're like \"Brandon, if you're so against VIM what are you going to use instead?\" I'm going to use my keyboard, just remapped a bit. The key thing I find myself hating about my current keyboard setup that I have tried to fix with VIM is rapid navigation and selection. I feel like I've gotten most of the way there by borrowing a handful of navigation commands from *Jason Rudolph*'s [Keyboard](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard)\nwhich I call [Super Duper Keyboard](../Super%20Duper%20Keyboard.md). It allows me to get Command, Option, Shift and all the arrow keys without having to leave the home row. Yes, this isn't all the power of VIM, but it gets me the parts that I feel I use constantly and I'm confident that they work everywhere because it just uses native MacOS cursor navigation just with the convenience of being on the home row.\n\nFull disclosure, as of the time of this writing: I have only been using this for about two weeks, so it's not fully in muscle memory yet, but it feels surprisingly natural.\n\n## Key Features:\n\n* Cursor Movement without leaving the home row\n* Move a Word forward and back\n* Move to end of line, beginning of line\n* Selection with each of them\n* Lastly, delete a word forward or back (I currently have it on the default of alt+h and alt+l, but I'm considering moving those to hyper+h and hyper+l)\n\n**Mentioned in this article:** \n\n* [VIM](../VIM.md)\n* [Vimium](../Vimium.md)\n* *kindaVim* — [Link](https://kindavim.app/)\n* Jason Rudolph's [Super Duper Keyboard](../Super%20Duper%20Keyboard.md)\n* [Karabiner](../Karabiner.md)\n* [Hammerspoon](../Hammerspoon.md)\n\n### If you are a VIM user, I would love to know what is the feature that makes it worth it, feel free to use the link below to email me.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.358576175-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Why-I-start-with-Analog-Tools-and-you-probably-should-too":{"title":"Why I start with Analog Tools and you probably should, too","content":"\n[Digital Tools](../moc/Digital%20Workflow.md) are excellent and essential, but they are a terrible place to start. When you're working on a new idea and the possibilities are still endless, the linear flow of modern digital tools is a recipe to build something like the things you've already built or someone else has already built. Starting with digital also increases the risk of missing the point of the project altogether by working in high fidelity before you've truly figured out the essence of what you're trying to make.\n\nFor years, I used paper notebooks for this step in my process, but about 2 years ago, I gave [E-Ink](../eInk.md) a try, and I haven't looked back. E-Ink devices, like the [reMarkable 2](../reMarkable%202.md), have the conveniences of [Analog Tools](../Analog%20Tools.md), combined with digital portability and collaboration. As a User Experience designer, there are often times when I have an image in mind or even on my sketchbook, but I'm trying to discuss it with one of my coworkers via Zoom. Not only can they not see what's in my mind, they also can't see what's in my sketchbook. I'm effectively left with just my words to try to communicate the vision for this idea. With E-Ink, I can share my drawing screen in real-time with my colleague and that person can see exactly what I see. If a detail about the sketch isn't quite right (or I haven't explored that detail yet), we can explore that together. E-Ink can bridge the gaps created by a remote workforce. When I'm done with this step in the process, I can share the result with others without having to rip the page out of my notebook or find a camera or scanner.\n\n### Additional Ideas\n\n* [Start with Analog Tools](../Start%20with%20Analog%20Tools.md)\n* *Analog tools enable non-linear thinking*\n* *Analog tools enable exploration*\n* *Work from low-fidelity to high-fidelity*\n* *ideas in our minds are of the lowest fidelity*\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.071766957-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/reMarkable-3-Beta-First-Impressions":{"title":"reMarkable 3 Beta First Impressions","content":"\nI've been using the *reMarkable* 3.0 Beta for the past week. Here are my initial impressions. \n\n* Being able to extend a page beyond A4 size is a huge improvement. Often I am forced to start a new page to continue a thought. Being able to have one page per ideas is very nice. \n\n* Being able to extend a page also opens up a better workflow to have one page per day. Previously, I couldn't fit my notes for a given day on one page, so I didn't attempt this. This works well now!\n\n* The ability to scroll pages is excellent, but I wish it remembered my scroll position when I leave the document and come back.\n\n* The new extendable pages now make using the reMarkable in *landscape mode* desirable. You can get a larger working space while still having as much height as you need. Excellent.\n\n* Landscape mode still doesn't allow you to view the gallery in a landscape orientation. This makes landscape mode feel half-baked. \n\n* Being able to undo and redo actions via a two-finger tap is excellent. The only time I use the eraser now is when I need to erase something I wrote awhile ago.\n\n* The idea of typing in a reMarkable document makes a lot of sense once it's hooked up for typing within the reMarkable app. It is not hooked up yet.\n\n* If you try to *SSH* into your reMarkable, and it closes the connection, you can fix this by remove the host from your known_hosts file.\n\n* I miss [DDVK hacks](../DDVK%20hacks.md), but I'm sure they will support 3.0 eventually. \n\nFor more details on the reMarkable 3.0 beta, check out my video here: https://youtu.be/xPEqzmU5-xg\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.01784647-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/reMarkable-Resources-when-getting-started":{"title":"reMarkable Resources when getting started","content":"\n## rM2 Template Making\n\n[rM2 Template Helper \u0026 Custom Screens](https://www.freeremarkabletools.com/index.asp?ds=ok)\nhttps://youtu.be/7FHBSLMShVc\n[Whitelines for Remarkable](https://github.com/steka/reMarkable_templates)\nhttps://github.com/Templarian/Remarkable\nhttps://rm.ezb.io/\n\n## rM2 Highlights\n\n[Python Library for pulling Remarkable highlights](https://remarking.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)\n\n## Screensharing\n\nhttps://github.com/rien/reStream\nhttps://github.com/bordaigorl/rmview\n\n## Screen Alignment Issues\n\n[Example and how to fix magnetization](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/m82oes/do_you_experience_the_same_weird_bug/?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=ios_app\u0026utm_name=iossmf)\n\n## Remarkable Hacking\n\n[DDVK Hack](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-hacks)\n\n* [Stylus Hack for use with DDVK](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-stylus)\n  [Standalone Stylus Hack](https://github.com/isaacwisdom/RemarkableLamyEraser)\n  [GitHub - funkey/recept: Pen event interception for line smoothing on the reMarkable 2 tablet](https://github.com/funkey/recept/)\n  https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/78u90n/passwordless_ssh_setup_for_remarkable_tablet/ (Optional, but helpful)\n  http://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/\n\n## Meta\n\n[reMarkable 2](../reMarkable%202.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.498214904-04:00","tags":null},"/coaching-is-all-about-asking-the-right-question-in-the-right-moment-to-uncover-the-path-forward-for-your-client":{"title":"coaching is all about asking the right question in the right moment to uncover the path forward for your client","content":"\n[Coaching](Coaching.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.046801331-04:00","tags":null},"/convergent-thinking":{"title":"convergent thinking","content":"\nability to drill down, creating more focus\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.45645279-04:00","tags":null},"/cooking/Brussels-Sprouts":{"title":"Brussels Sprouts","content":"\n*Cooking*\n\n*2022-01-13* Halved until all about the same size.

In the future, I need to close the cover sooner and cut the oxygen to it before it gets too hot. I cooked the chicken around ~225° until it reached 145°, and then I opened it up in an attempt to get the skin crispy. I think it may have worked, but then I applied the BBQ sauce and that lost any crisp I achieved. I put three pieces of hickory in with the fire today and I think that was too much.

I brushed it with olive oil on both sides (perhaps I should only do that on the bottom side) and I coated it in a new rub I found here: https://fitfoodiefinds.com/smoked-chickljken-dry-rub-recipe/. I did my typical cook at 220 until 145 degrees and then cranked up the temperature to 275ish to crisp the skin. The skin still didn't turn out quite crispy enough but its getting better. I then finished it with the South Carolina BBQ sauce and let that cook on it for 5 minutes or so. The flavor was great and having the BBQ sauce on the outside gave great flavor. \nThis was the first time I've tried serving the chicken in whole pieces.

I think I've been erring on the side of too little fuel, but there is very little downside to more fuel. I also used significantly too much seasoning this time around, and it was very salty. The amount the first time was right, I just didn't care for the rub much. The meat itself was wonderfully tender, but the skin turned too salty and wasn't crispy enough.\n\n\n*2022-03-20*\nThis was my first time using the *Char-Griller Akorn*. I set an initial fire in the Akorn to get it to 400 degrees to season the grill grate. This worked well, and I had no issues getting the grill to high temperature, even getting it past 500 degrees. I had a minor challenge where I put the fire out while trying to reduce the temperature significantly to get back to a smoking temperature after running it at high heat. After relighting the fire I cooked the chicken between 225 and 275 for an hour and half until the chicken got to an internal temperature of 145 degrees. At the point, I raised the heat to 325 to crisp up the skin and make it easier to get the chicken to temperature. For this chicken we used a KC BBQ rub along with mayonnaise and olive oil on the underside. Initially I didn't put enough seasoning on the chicken, but we later added a bit more. The fire was likely 8 to 2 lump to hickory. The chicken was cooked very nicely, but I found the rub to be too sweet for chicken (its probably better suited for pork). I may try something simpler like just salt and pepper next time to see how that compares. For this cook, we were lacking the smoking stone, but were able to substitute in a baking sheet instead for today. The smoking stone will be here tomorrow along with a thermometer that will talk to my phone so that I can monitor the fire from afar. \n\n\n---\n\n### References\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JJx4eZNmz4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0de3Q9hQSTA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y7gM1deyvw\u0026t=1s\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:25.95778215-04:00","tags":null},"/core-hours":{"title":"core hours","content":"\nThis is the idea that everyone must be in the office from say 10-3\n\n*Remote Work*\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:25.857177182-04:00","tags":null},"/data-ownership":{"title":"data ownership","content":"\nDo you own your *data*, or are you renting it back from some other service?\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.346934638-04:00","tags":null},"/divergent-thinking":{"title":"divergent thinking","content":"\nability to brainstorm, thinking broadly\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.518959918-04:00","tags":null},"/eInk":{"title":"eInk","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.01012746-04:00","tags":null},"/eInk-Tablet-Styluses":{"title":"eInk Tablet Styluses","content":"\n### Rankings\n\n1.

It was simple, well-designed and looked great. I ultimately passed on it because I didn't like their business model of charging for their connectivity tools, like exporting notes to Google Drive or screen-sharing *(Note this changed as of Sept 2022)*. It also didn't have a backlight or Kindle support, so I bought the [Boox Note Air 2 Plus](Boox%20Note%20Air%202%20Plus.md) instead. I did a review on that and after that review I was getting a bunch of questions about how the Boox compared, but I didn't have a point of reference to compare it to, so I ultimately bought a reMarkable 2, so I could compare. \n\n## Form Factor, Design \u0026 Build Quality\n\n* Design-wise it is an amazingly designed piece of hardware. It looks and feels premium. \n  * These little rubber feet on the back are a nice touch and prevent the device from sliding around the table.\n  * I like the way they hid the charge port in the bottom-left of the device\n  * The sleep button being on the top also feels great.\n  * The white bezels are beautiful.\n  * The device is taller than the Boox, but is thinner. It's only slightly thinner, but you can tell. I really enjoy the form factor of the reMarkable. \n  * I think it feels more premium than the [Boox Note Air 2 Plus](Boox%20Note%20Air%202%20Plus.md) and significantly more so than the  [Supernote A5 X](Supernote%20A5%20X.md).\n  * I love that the sides are less rounded than the Boox so that the magnetic pen actually stays where it's supposed to\n* Similarly to the [Supernote A5 X](Supernote%20A5%20X.md) there is no backlight on this device. They do this to minimize the distance between the pen tip and the eInk rendering to make the handwriting more convincing, but I don't find the Boox's backlit display to feel inferior to write on.\n  * There is no backlight, but the screen is at least bright white so as long as you have a decent amount of light you will be able to see what is going on well.\n* It does have a glass front and back and is breakable. I would treat this the way I would a laptop. It should go in a padding pocket in your bag if you're going to put it in one.\n  * If you want a device that doesn't feel as nice, but can take more abuse, then check out the [Supernote A5 X](Supernote%20A5%20X.md). \n\n## Writing Look \u0026 Feel\n\n* When I first got the reMarkable, I was extremely confused by it. It had ultra low-latency, great tooling and attention to detail, but the handwritten text looked awful. I was perplexed by it and on more than one occasion I wondered to myself \"why do people like this device?\" It felt inherently flawed. It turns out the device isn't bad, just the fineliner is. I absolutely hate the writing look and feel of the fineliner. And somehow was the pen that was selected (I think because I like fineliners in real life). Once I found the Ballpoint pen, nearly all of my issues were solved. \n* The handwriting has extremely low latency. It has the lowest latency of all the devices, and feels great, but I would gladly trade some latency for better anti-aliasing\n  * A leaked beta build showed that they were working on anti-aliasing on page turn which would be a very clever way to maintain the low latency while still having great looking and convincing handwriting after the fact. \n* reMarkable has in my opinion the most satisfying writing feel of all the devices.\n  * Similar to the Boox, but perhaps a bit more rough. \n    * The continuum is reMarkable roughest (traditional pencil), Boox is ever so slightly smoother (mechanical pencil) and the SuperNote is much smoother (gel pen on pad of paper)\n  * Visceral and fluid without any of the fatigue of real paper\n* Be aware of screen magnitization, when I first got the device I thought I got a bad digitizer because the lines were not lining up with where I was writing (especially near the edges of the device), but I found out the device was just being magnetized by the other devices I was using near it. You can slide your stylus sideways across the device to make this issue go away.  [Link to magnetization info](https://github.com/reMarkable/linux/issues/13)\n\n## Software\n\n* The software is simple, and that's a good thing. \n  * You open the device and you have a single list of documents. Some that you created on the device and some that may have imported as PDFs.\n* Everything about the software feels snappy and responsive.\n  * Page flips \n  * The device wakes very quickly\n  * It seems like reMarkable truly uses the device themselves and it feels like it values my time the most of any of the three devices.\n  * I like the keyboard a lot, but it does feel weird that they don't have the handwriting to text like the Boox device. \n* I found myself after a few minutes going, is that it? Is that all it can do, but after using it in practice I love that everything is in one place because it leads to me processing the documents I create instead of them languishing on the device forever\n* This device is a high-powered notebook, and that's about it\n  * This device can do some basic reading of PDFs, but no Kindle support. After using all of these devices, I come to the conclusion that if you want to read a simple novel, just use a Kindle. It's the best experience for that. \n* Quick sheets is a lovely way to take a quick note without having to throw it into the wrong notebook. It's a little thing, but a nice touch.\n* Per page tagging is very handy. I use it to ensure I transfer all of my important notes back to my source of truth. (Notion for work things and Obsidian for personal)\n  * You can also do document level tagging\n* Aside from tags there are no clever titles feature or stars for tasks like on the SuperNote, so if you are looking for something to replace your daily planner you should probably look at the SuperNote (I will have my review of that linked above)\n* The highlighter is beautiful and delightful to use\n  * When in PDFs it aligns with the text you're highlighting\n    * I haven't found a good off the shelf solution to easily get these highlights off of the device. There is the rmApi project that can successfully pull this data, but the project that attempts to do this appears broken since a recent reMarkable Api update. Here's hoping someone can find a way to integrate it with [Readwise](Readwise.md). If no one does, I might write something at some point. \n* The tablet runs on *Linux.* For context, the Supernote and Boox run on *Android.* The linux architecture opens up significant room to tinker, and I believe is a significant factor in how snappy the device feels. \n  * For my particular device I use the DDVK Hack which is a patched firmware to fill in some missing functionality in the base reMarkable UX\n    * Quick Tool Switching\n    * Gestures to quick swap between two documents\n      * This opens up the ability to read and keep notes in a separate document or two switch between two frequently used notebooks.\n        * For example a personal notebook and a work notebook\n    * Ability to see your active tool when you disable the UI\n    * Ability to use the eraser button with non-reMarkable stylus (be sure to install the additional stylus hack it is not bundled with the base package)\n    * Easy undo/redo gestures (not as good as SuperNote but still really good)\n    * I turned off the Bookmarking gesture \n    * Out of the box the device is not very left friendly because of the back button in the top right\n  * With the DDVK hacks I think the reMarkable software is very close to as good as Supernote's which I regard as the best when it comes to usability for writing and getting things done. \n    * If you aren't, intending on installing the DDVK hacks, then you might find it a little barebones. \n\n* In my opinion, reMarkable has the best companion app of the tablets. \n  * It's nice to be able to load up the reMarkable app on my Mac and see all of my notes there instead of having to flip to it on my tablet, if all I want to do is review things. \n  * Synchronization is very quick and I don't find myself having to manually sync. It just works and that is awesome. \n  * You can do this even without the connect membership, but thats a bit moot with reMarkable's recent change to give majority of the connect features for free. \n\n* The out-of-the-box templates are plentiful and well-designed. The dot grid template on the reMarkable is better than the default one of the Boox.\n  * I have since emulated that template on the Boox and the Supernote\n* I will note that the reMarkable software hasn't evolved or improved in the time I have had the device. There have been a couple bug fix updates, but that's it. Their team did announce that they have big changes coming towards the end of the year and hopefully that's why we haven't seen any real updates.\n\n## Business Practices\n\n* Putting *Google Drive* syncing and screensharing behind a monthly fee feels weird and honestly probably loses them some customers. (They have since fixed this as of 9/21/22, Well done reMarkable)\n* I do like that they don't bundle their stylus in with the device. This brings the overall price of the device down significantly. I think $279 USD if you use a referral code. I will include mine in the description if you decide you want to pick up the device. I don't like that they overcharge for their stylus, making it look like you can get the device for $259, but by the time you get through checkout you are looking at close to $400 dollars because their stylus is $129. \n  * Making it so that the Eraser on third-party styluses doesn't work is a slimy way to sell more overpriced Markers. reMarkable if you make your markers worthy of their price people will prefer them over the competing styluses. \n\n## Wish List\n\n* I wish I could write in the titles of my notebooks. The Boox does this very well. It's surprising it's not here on the reMarkable\n* BETTER ANTI-ALIASING!\n* I wish screen-sharing wasn't locked behind a monthly fee. This has been fixed as of 9/21/22\n* Make other people's stylus work out of the box. \n* Let me keep my common pens together on the toolbar and also let me have them persist across notebooks\n* I wish my notebooks were synced in the background on idle instead of having to go to the home screen.\n* The device is minimalist, and I like minimalism, but this feels a bit too minimalist\n  * If I want to move my toolbar to the bottom of the screen I should be able to\n  * I wish there was a way to refresh the screen manually. This device has more ghosting than the Boox or SuperNote. It's not a big deal, but when you get some you are largely helpless to it.\n  * I wish it had a lasso stroke eraser. That is my favorite style of eraser\n* I wish it did smart shapes like in *GoodNotes*\n\n## Conclusion / Who should buy this?\n\nThe reMarkable 2 is the *iPhone* of eInk tablets. Its feature-set is limited, but it does the right things and does those very well. The device is very simple and intuitive. Perhaps barebones, but it is the tablet I pick up when I want to think or explore an idea.\n\nIf you decide to pick up a reMarkable and consider me a friend, you can use my referral code to save $40. https://link.brandonkboswell.com/rm2\n\n### Meta\n\n[reMarkable resources when getting started](blog/reMarkable%20Resources%20when%20getting%20started.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:25.870058394-04:00","tags":null},"/second-brain":{"title":"second brain","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:25.92151299-04:00","tags":null},"/seedlings/Always-write-down-the-outcome-of-your-thinking-so-that-we-can-refer-back-and-build-upon-it":{"title":"Always write down the outcome of your thinking so that we can refer back and build upon it","content":"\n*Creative Thought*\n[Don't Start from Scratch](Don't%20Start%20from%20Scratch.md)\n[Building a foundation](Building%20a%20foundation.md)\n\nIncluding possible connections to future inquiries\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:25.844609473-04:00","tags":null},"/seedlings/Avoid-a-second-cup-of-coffee-for-better-sleep":{"title":"Avoid a second cup of coffee for better sleep","content":"\n[Sleep](../Sleep.md)\n*Afternoon Coffee* / *Afternoon Tea*\n\nSecond cup of coffee is wrecking my sleep tonight.

But as it is, Siddhartha can wait calmly. He is not impatient. He is not in need. He can ward off hunger for a long time and laugh at it.

Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? Quote? The first answer to any question is a much fun because it's just automatic. What's the first painting that comes to mind? Mona Lisa. Name a genius. Einstein Who's a composer. Mozart. This is the subject of the book, Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. There's the instant, unconscious automatic thinking, and then there's the slower, conscious, rational, deliberate thinking. I'm really, really into the slower thinking, breaking my automatic responses to the things in my life and slowly thinking through a more deliberate response. Instead, then for the things in life where an automatic ([Time 0:30:21](https://www.airr.io/quote/618bf5ea3aae6012c8528f04))\n\n---\n\nthat comes to mind? Why are they actually more successful than the first person that came to mind? In that case, the first would be Richard Branson because he's the stereotype. He's like the Mona Lisa of success to me. Honestly, you might be my second answer, but we could talk about that a different time. My third and riel answer after thinking it through, is that we can't know without knowing a person's aims. What if Richard Branson set out to live a quiet life, but like a compulsive gambler, he just can't stop creating companies. Then that changes everything, and we can call him successful anymore.

You've probably heard the fable. I think it's Borodin's ass about a donkey who is standing halfway between a pile of hay and a bucket of water. He just keeps looking left to the hay and right to the water, trying to decide. Hey or water Hey! Or water. He's unable to decide, so he eventually falls over and dies of both hunger and thirst. A donkey can't think of the future. If he did, he'd realize he could clearly go first to drink the water. Then go eat the hay. So my advice to my 30 year old self is, don't be a donkey. You can do everything you want to do. You just need foresight and patients. ([Time 0:34:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/619135213aae6012c8371501))\n\n---\n\nstartup vacation starting in late 2015.

It sounds like from where you are, your decision is not between yes and no.

That is the deliberation that I have in my own head. And I do actually have hundreds of drafts like I have shitty stuff, but it's never quite cross the chasm into good enough to publish. So I've been stymieing myself in that respect, and there's part of me that's like, you know what? The podcast is easier. It's fun. I feel like it's a craft I'm still improving on. Why don't I just do that? There is part of me that says that, then there's another part that says, That's a cop out. In fact, you know, the writing helps you to learn to think as Kevin Kelly to invoke that name again, right? He writes, to think he doesn't think and then right, and that I'm short changing myself by using perfectionism ([Time 0:26:11](https://www.airr.io/quote/615f5292cceec3ea04fef53d))\n\n[Writing to Think](../Write%20it%20down.md)\n\n---\n\nme feel the way that book made me feel. And after that book came out, I felt the same way again. Which is, well, if this is the journey, I found the end of the journey, and I realized 69 months later that that was selfish, and that leads to the other key thing I wanna talk about, which is generosity. *Generosity* doesn't mean free people pay for our surgeon is going to save their life generosity means that you're expending emotional energy, *emotional labor*, help somebody else. And as soon as I could shift it around in my head to say, There's somebody over there who could use a hand, then it wasn't about me anymore, and I wasn't ([Time 0:30:40](https://www.airr.io/quote/615f539fcceec3ea04fff525))\n\n---\n\nTomorrow morning when you wake up, you probably won't feel like engaging in *the practice*. And if you do, you probably won't feel that way the next day that what we do is once decide. We decide that we're a runner and runners go running every day. We decide we're a blogger and bloggers blogged every day, and that decision lightens the cognitive load so much because there's no time, no reason to negotiate with ourselves because we already had the meeting, we already decided. Now the question is not. Should we go or not? The question is, should we go left or right? But we're going. Are there other macro decisions ([Time 0:34:26](https://www.airr.io/quote/615f5408cceec3ea04004a91))\n\n---\n\nthat extra beat? Well, that's a skill, and you know, whether it's Dale Carnegie or anyone who's followed in his footsteps, you can learn those things, and at first you seem as awkward as someone who just learned how to ride a bike, and then you don't got it. So, uh, I should also say that just to reinforce what you're saying, becoming a better listener and that extra beat training yourself to utilize that extra beat is absolutely a practice. I member Calif Usman, who wrote for Esquire for ages and ages and ages and has interviewed everybody. Mohammed Ali E.

She didn't say, 00 I'm bad at this and then go work at a 7 11 And so where we need patience is in confronting the things we're going to get better at and in strapping in for, ah, useful journey and where we need impatience is with our fear and with our selfishness about worrying.

Be generous with the work and improve our skills so we can do it again. And that gets back to Elizabeth King's quote. You are a fantastic presenter, public speaker, teacher. Of course, these things tied together, although not all good public presenters or good teachers. But you are excellent at all those things. And remember advice I was given which I don't follow Aziz well, as many, which is presentations, fail more often from too much information rather than too little. I think this is true books also in part of the reason why, as one instance, the four hour chef was such a ([Time 0:45:45](https://www.airr.io/quote/6166ff353b174903fa670a37))\n\n---\n\nwhen you have assets, when you have a chance to go forward. And in the book, I tell the story of R E M and R. E. M was a successful college radio band that was gigging hundreds of times a year. But they were not the r m of today. They weren't this famous, legendary band, and they made two decisions they invented to constraints before they made a new album, and the constraints were We're going to stop touring for four months and you'd be amazed at how few bands and that constraint if you saw the Go Go's documentary, the Go Go's would have definitely had a half a dozen more hit albums if they had just stopped touring for three months when they were all burning out.

And so I didn't write the sequel to Permission Marketing, and I didn't start mail chimp and I didn't. You know, there's all these things I could have done if I was a business builder.

Why write this book So as you and I both know writing a book is a ridiculous venture. It takes a really long time, and then when you're done with it, almost nobody says fantastic the way they do say, if you made a new record because when you make a record, you go, I'll listen to it. But you make a book. They asked for a prize because they finished reading it. Um, so I only write a book when I have no choice and what makes me have no choice? Well, what I learned a really long time ago is once I ([Time 1:16:21](https://www.airr.io/quote/615f7a45cceec3ea0422a174))\n\n---\n\nthe learning to throw instead of catch. If someone were to ask you, how would you teach someone to be creative? And I'm asking that in a deliberately may be problematic way. But what would your answer be if they were, like, great, I get the swimming example, I get the juggling example. I want to be more creative. What's the equivalent for becoming more creative? What would you say? It's exactly the same, and I've done it many, many times. Here you go. If you wanna learn how to juggle, you have to drop an enormous number of balls. If you wanna learn how to swim, you have to sort of drown. And if you wanna learn to be creative, you have to show me an enormous number of bad ideas. Pick the smallest ([Time 1:25:10](https://www.airr.io/quote/615fbe76cceec3ea0460c5a3))\n\n---\n\nof course it is because Marissa and the rest said, Let's not have 183 links on the home page. Let's have to The search results themselves weren't that different for years. But the leap was you know what a search engine is. This is just like that search engine, except it's different. But if they hadn't seen Yahoo and Alta Vista, they never could have built Google. And we wouldn't have known what to do with it if we hadn't seen a search engine. And so what Genre says is there's a box and I can't think outside the box because it's dark. But on the edges of the box, I have leverage. You got to know what the boxes before you can make a thing that is going to be seen as creative. Uh huh.

His name's Bill Boomer Bill had a very significant potbelly and one arm, and I'm like, This guy is going to teach us how to swim.

It is true that every once in a while, an outsider shows up with something that nobody on the inside ever thought off. But that's not usually what happened. What usually happens is someone who has good taste decides to be willing to be creative and good taste means you *know what your audience wants 10 minutes before they do*, that's all. You can't have good taste unless you have *domain knowledge* and understand genre.

So I organize my week in thematic approach meaning rather than taking the five types of activities that I need or want to cover each week and spreading them throughout each day. I tend to have a day dedicated to different types of work. So Tuesday will involve lots and lots of phone calls or at least that's when I'll batch my phone calls with my team and with other people. So very frequently I will not do any type of journaling on that day but start walking and talking.

Sometimes we might get lost and trying to accomplish things instead of thinking about what is worth working for. Really, this is an energetic canary in the coal mine, for me, in the sense that if you find yourself low energy, which is very often accompanied by depressive or pessimistic thoughts, then I will do a number of things including 8020 analysis and some form of dream lining is outlined in the four hour workweek. But I ([Time 0:12:15](https://www.airr.io/quote/619abd3c3aae6012c8972767))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: Say 20% of people and activities that are producing 80% or more of my peak positive emotional states. And then on the other side, peak negative emotional states or negative ads and negative subtractions. And I will look at that. But but really it's just using a simple rubric. Like how quickly do you fall asleep and how do you feel when you first wake up, when you first wake up? Is there a feeling of dread of, Oh fuck, I have to slog through another day of not really knowing where I'm going or is it a different feeling? So for me, as Jodie Foster once said, I believe could be mis attribution.

So it's really how do you feel right before you get better when you go to bed and how do you feel right when you wake up and if something is off, I believe, you know, it it doesn't need to be put into a spreadsheet and analyzed. ([Time 0:13:20](https://www.airr.io/quote/619abd7d3aae6012c8972ff8))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: It seems to me that it is a personal decision of sorts. Perhaps that is with a vocation. Perhaps you feel called something, perhaps you pursue something. But I'm looking for models of people who have done that. And so I think biographies will also hold an important position in my trying to navigate this particular period in my life. So there you have my answer in a way to both of those. All right, so let me scroll down, see what other questions we have in the live stream Andrew Robinson. If you were asked to give a commencement speech, what would be the core message?

And secondly, some of my hesitation has been around my genetic predisposition and it is a genetic predisposition.

So let's not use self compassion. But what about meditating? 20 minutes in the morning, this will help you to become more self aware. Let's start there. Forget about compassion. If you have the ability to pause even for a few seconds before reflexively responding, say in anger or in anything if you have the ability to be more self aware so that you can regulate more effectively. Will that make you more effective or will that make you less effective? I think it will make you more effective.

Because my unproductive thought or emotional loop is triggered by some bullshit that gets foisted upon me like a hot potato. And I would say in combination with not my circus, not my monkeys. The expression, your lack of preparation does not constitute my emergency, which was said to me once way back in the day when I was getting started because I was trying to rush someone to do something and it is simply a reminder that if you allow everyone else's ([Time 0:58:10](https://www.airr.io/quote/619c153b3aae6012c8dc4848))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: ted lasso, L A S.

And very frequently I would say, you know, once or twice a week I will try to read. This is often if I am feeling anxious for whatever reason or rushed, But without a clear explanation, I will meditate, have my tear coffee, then lay down on the couch with my dog and read for 30 to 60 minutes.

That removes a lot of the pressure to make yourself understood if that makes any sense. So if the secret to happiness is low expectations, as I was told by one of my danish friends when I asked them why Denmark rated as one of the happiest countries on earth, then perhaps the key to overcoming the fear of being misunderstood is just to assume that everyone misunderstands everyone and that there is no point that it is pissing in the wind to try to prevent people from misunderstanding you.

And some cynics in the audience are like “dude every other book you read seems to change your life, this is just clickbait”.

This is your title, thumbnail, and first 30 seconds of your video. Things that should grab the attention of a potential viewer and keep them watching. Then you move on to the Intro. Once they’ve decided to watch your video, you need to explain the why behind it. Tell your viewers why they should keep watching, what you’re explaining/providing/going to show and how that thing relates to their situation. Next is Value. Throughout the whole video, you want to show the value of your production through elements of writing (video script) and branding (video editing). The point is to make it memorable and to stand out compared to the rest of the productions in the same niche. Here’s where you make them say “Wow, they really took time to make this video special.” And you want to finish it off with the End Screen Sales Pitch. You don’t want to leave your viewers with anything. The best thing you can do is relate the end bit of a video with another video on that correlating topic. Take a look at this video as an example. This way you’ll keep them in a loop and you create a situation where people genuinely want to check out your next video.

Perhaps you’ve experienced just such an awkward window of time like this — such as in-between Zoom meetings or something. And so, allow me to suggest a few ways to spend those few minutes... If you Use Day One scroll through your Day One timeline and read a previous journal entry. Browse some old photos and memories. Launch Day One (or any other journal you have) and log how you’ve spent your time so far for the day. Doing this for a few weeks can also be super helpful for getting a perspective of where your time and energy are being spent. Write down 3 new ideas. These could be articles you want to write, business ideas, places you want to visit or photograph, topics you want to research, date ideas for you and your spouse, gift ideas for a friend, etc. These ideas never have to to be acted on — the point isn’t to generate a to-do list, but rather to exercise your mind. Ideation and creativity are muscles, and the more we exercise them the stronger they get. Send a text message to a friend or family member to tell them how awesome they are. Stand up and do some stretching / body movement. #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.075648442-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/2x2-Lists-Lists-Lists....-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail":{"title":"2x2 Lists, Lists, Lists.... - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail","content":"\n# 2x2: Lists, Lists, Lists.... - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Create account*\n* Full Title: 2x2: Lists, Lists, Lists.... - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n* URL: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzGmvTxVKczjwkdlWKjTnzhdKbbf\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nI’ve been using Day One as my journal app for about a decade. And, there have certainly been times when I write and journal far less than I would like — sometimes I just don’t have any interest or motivation to write in there. A new approach to journaling that I picked up about a month ago, is something that makes it very easy to create a Day One entry. And, more often than not, it leads me to continue writing. The approach is to simply finish this sentence: “Today was a good day because....”. \n\n---\n\nOne type of goal is an attainment goal: something with a clear definition of completion that you achieve or accomplish. The other type is a Lifestyle Goal: a habit or routine that you incorporate into your everyday lifestyle.

People who want to be big sometimes think, \"I have to immediately reach the largest possible audience.\" But in a weird way, the best way to produce things that take off is to produce small things. To become a small expert. To become the best person on the internet at understanding the application of Medicaid to minority children, or something like that. And the reason why I think this is true I call my Tokyo example. If you go to Tokyo, you'll see there are all sorts of really, really strange shops. There'll be a shop that's only 1970's vinyl and like, 1980's whisky or something. And that doesn't make any sense if it's a shop in a Des Moines suburb, right? In a Des Moines suburb, to exist, you have to be Subway. You have to hit the mass-market immediately. But in Tokyo, where there's 30-40 million people within a train ride of a city, then your market is 40 million. And within that 40 million, sure, there's a couple thousand people who love 1970's music and 1980's whisky. The Internet is Tokyo. The Internet allows you to be niche at scale.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.285160974-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/3-2-1-How-to-Be-Alone-Taking-Action-and-Choosing-Your-Heroes-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail":{"title":"3-2-1 How to Be Alone, Taking Action, and Choosing Your Heroes - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *James Clear*\n* Full Title: 3-2-1: How to Be Alone, Taking Action, and Choosing Your Heroes - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n* URL: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzGmthnjwKFtpfZJdFxbjsmbnHxJ\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\n\"Now is the time to get serious about living your ideals.

This helps us fully visualize and get feedback on every detail of our designs before writing any code. However, I'd argue that this level of fidelity can be a huge distraction in the early life of a product.

It's about maintaining focus on the right questions at the right time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h05bne8cf76mc49tg729by8m))\n\n---\n\nNow, I will say that we can do that because we're a small team and my background in motion graphics helps me make those design decisions on the fly.\nBut you can still make a similar system work on larger teams by having a dedicated designer finalize page mockups in Figma while engineers focus on making the feature work with the sketches as scaffolding. Then, once the designer is done, the frontend engineers can go back and add in the extra levels of detail. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h05bs7qzfdybjmqhweja28f0))\n\n---\n\nA tool that I like using for deciding scope and resolving priority is [breadboarding](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#elements-are-the-output). It's a technique for sketching out the flows and capabilities of our products without thinking about UI *at all*.\nThere are three pieces to a breadboard diagram like the one shown below: places, affordances, and connections: *Places* are the underlined headings that represent screens, sections, pages, and popups. *Affordances* are things within those places that the user can see and interact with - like buttons, links, form fields, and text copy. *Connections* are lines that show where a user goes after interacting with an affordance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h05bx2jczdw5m0ec8sb5hv3p))\n\n*Breadboarding*\n\n---\n\nI think we should play to the strengths of Figma and treat our prototypes as what they are: pictures.\nThey're drawings of what *could* be. Clicking through them is an exercise in thinking about what the user *could* experience.

Companies expect you to answer email on the weekends and evenings, but think that you’re a terrible employee if you want to run an errand during the workday. They feel as if any hour you don’t work for them is an hour you stole. #status/review \n\n---\n\nOne point I agree on is that you must ship8. I’ve talked to many people that want to have courses, or write a book. One big constant is that they never put the time in to doing the work required to accomplish these goals. If you want to write, and spend your evenings watching TV instead of doing the work of writing…you just want to have written. You don’t like writing, you want to be an accomplished author. You love a dream not the process of getting to the dream. #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:25.86081979-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/4-loops-that-cause-creative-struggle":{"title":"4 loops that cause creative struggle","content":"\n* Author: *Janis Ozolins* \n* URL: https://twitter.com/ozolinsjanis/status/1420344259367030784?s=12\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.11333857-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/40-Questions-to-Ask-Yourself-Every-Decade":{"title":"40 Questions to Ask Yourself Every Decade","content":"\n# 40 Questions to Ask Yourself Every Decade\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://stephanango.com/assets/favicon.ico)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Stephan Ango*\n* Full Title: 40 Questions to Ask Yourself Every Decade\n* URL: https://stephanango.com/40-questions-decade\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\n• What would you do if you had 6 months to live?\n• What would you do if you had a billion dollars?\n• What advice would you give yourself 10 years ago?\n• What do you hope will be the same 10 years from now?\n• What do you hope will be different 10 years from now?\n• What is your idea of perfect happiness?\n• When and where were you happiest?\n• Why do you get out of bed in the morning?\n• What do you consider the lowest depth of misery?\n• What is your most marked characteristic?\n• What is your greatest fear?\n• What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n• What is the trait you most deplore in others?\n• On what occasion do you lie?\n• What is your greatest extravagance?\n• What do you consider the most overrated virtue?\n• What do you most dislike about your appearance?\n• If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?\n• Which talent would you most like to have?\n• What do people frequently misunderstand about you?\n• What is the quality you most like in a man?\n• What is the quality you most like in a woman?\n• What do you most value in your friends?\n• What do you consider your greatest achievement?\n• If you could give everyone in the world one gift, what would it be?\n• What was your greatest waste of time?\n• What do you find painful but worth doing?\n• Where would you most like to live?\n• What is your most treasured possession?\n• Who is your best friend?\n• Who or what is the greatest love of your life?\n• Which living person do you most admire?\n• Who is your hero of fiction?\n• Which historical figure do you most identify with?\n• What is your greatest regret?\n• How would you like to die?\n• What is your motto?\n• What is the best compliment you ever received?\n• What is the luckiest thing that happened to you?\n• What makes you hopeful?

You have a website that says you are a person that likes clean modern design, whereas you can imagine there's this, what is it called? The Professor style website, which is these kind of like very bare bones. Html You know, not only is it not responsive design but it's like barely even styled at all, but you come to associate it with often busy and successful professors who are very erudite and accomplished in their field and they do have a representation online but would almost be confusing or maybe feel wrong in some way if they had a sleek, well designed site, like a designer, would that conveys maybe the wrong idea? \nSpeaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

For example, I started the design details podcast because I wanted to meet other people and what we did is we created a spreadsheet of 100 people who we wanted to meet and just started going down the list and emailing them And everyone was super kind and most people were open to being on this brand new podcast with these young 20something designers trying to figure out what they ([Time 0:17:24](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b487ba62ce94f7a954390e)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: as a friendly person who responds quickly and thoughtfully and carefully. But then there is a little bit of a burden there I suppose. I mean a good burden to have. It's awesome that people want to reach out and chat but sometimes it's overwhelming. I'm curious if you both have experiences because you both are also quite public and put yourselves out there \nSpeaker 2: in general. I'm very bullish on this channel that is cold contact over the public \nSpeaker 0: internet in both \nSpeaker 2: directions. I think people underestimate the opportunities that you can create by sending a good cold email or cold DM as it may be. And I think there's also a lot of value potentially being open and I've always been open for a similar reason, I think to you is I was incredibly fortunate to have people help me out as I was entering Silicon Valley, basically. On the basis of cold emails, \nSpeaker 1: Mark, I feel ([Time 0:19:15](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b4882862ce94f7a9544b29)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: or there's the case that's clear spam or something close to spam, let's say not classic spam necessarily, but something where I don't know, you know, the recruiter, the classic recruiter thing.

You know, I'm a student, I'm an entrepreneur, I'm something else.

I still try to like find a good reply if I can, but it's often ends up being more of a thanks for the nice words. I think you're doing something interesting.

And so one thing that I've started doing now recently with sort of these kinds of engagements with people, I don't know where it feels a little bit transactional as I try and explicitly request a follow up and the way I frame it is, hey, by the way, if you end up making a decision, I would love to hear how you made that decision if you learned anything. So a lot of times this will end up being like job hunting or negotiation, ([Time 0:24:44](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b4897262ce94f7a9547a3c)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 2: purposely build a brand as a first class goal and want to have a lot of followers either because they just enjoy playing that game or because they're in some type of role. We're having access to that marketing channel is valuable if they're developer advocate or they write a newsletter, someone like that and that again, is that sort of classical brand that you would think of if you compare it to something like coca cola, I think of it more as an asset that I can draw on when needed. So I don't particularly need any followers. I need the ability to point to something and say, hey, I'm reaching out to you, you can refer to this artifact and see that I'm a truthful person and that's really all that I personally and I think that covers most people now. there's a bit of a ([Time 0:27:26](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b48a1462ce94f7a9548c38)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 2: something good and valuable to say versus having a stock of reputational capital in \nSpeaker 0: the form of a bunch of followers. \nSpeaker 1: Mhm. Although being known for saying things that people want to hear definitely is a huge amplifier on anything you might say, which is maybe to that fortune cookie point, you can say basically pretty generic platitudes, but if your audience is big enough for you have this reputation where people just care about what you have to say, then yeah, they're excited about what would otherwise be a pretty bland statement. The other piece of this on the followers though is I would say that quality is not the right word, it's people who are following me for the right reason and I especially like the mutual follows and maybe the mutual followers thing just kind of takes you back to a little more of a classic social network where you have people who sort of all know ([Time 0:31:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b48b8762ce94f7a954bf51)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: the algorithm becomes very apparent, you can watch it in real time, take hold and you very subtly understand or maybe subconsciously understand what is going to get likes and what will probably not get likes and it just breaks your brain. At least I'll say it breaks my brain because it puts you in this position where you are tempted and also rewarded for oversimplifying polarizing, tweeting the hot take, criticizing those kinds of things. I think a good example that I ([Time 0:34:01](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b48c1a62ce94f7a954d31c)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: back to a concept we talked about in the company brand episode which is there's what's known as brand extension. And the general thing is the brand extension is basically a pretty bad idea and almost never works. So, you know, for example, Kleenex is known for making facial tissue if Kleenex makes printer paper, which perhaps is a similar product in the sense of how it's manufactured. Not only is it confusing withheld as Kleenex printer paper, but you've actually destroyed the brand equity of what Kleenexes in the mind of your customer and the recommendation there is generally make a new brand if you're truly transitioning to a different market. So maybe that does beg the question of should I have just started a new twitter account when I was ([Time 0:38:53](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b48d5d62ce94f7a9551094)) #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.204202347-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/52-Product-Launches":{"title":"52  Product Launches","content":"\n# 52 // Product Launches\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article4.6bc1851654a0.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Metamuse*\n* Full Title: 52 // Product Launches\n* URL: https://share.snipd.com/episode/29786985-db18-452c-b3fb-7006e1857a34\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nMarketing is Big, Like Basicly Frenzy\nSummary:\nIf you execute a product eventually should mostly not surprising to you. It's going to be news and therefore sort of surprising to a lot of the broad market. So for example, you've already released the product. You know that it works. And if so, you can anticipate that we'll catch ou will stick when you eventually do your marketing lunch.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nI think there's a theme here where if you execute a product lawntuali should mostly not surprising to you. It's going to be news and therefore sort of surprising to a lot of the broad market. But you can basically understand what's going to happen along a lot of these dimensions. So for example, you've already released the product. You know that it works. You should, by the way, be observing the rate that new bugs are coming in. And that should be hepefully decreasing and reaching some acceptable moderate level, because the bugs arn't going tosuddenly stop coming the day you release, righteso, you get a anticipate that also, you are alluding to this, you can basically batatest a lot of the marketing and messaging with the press. You can alsor this, with the user s. You can say, here's how we're proposing to talk about the products, and see if that resinates, if they're nodding their head up and down. And if so, you can anticipate that we'll catch ou will stick when you eventually do your marketing lunch. I think peoplell have in this mind, as users of products, that marketing is big, like basicly frenzy, where everything's super uncertain and everyone's figuring stuff out, and who knows if its goin to work or not.

The individuals matter less, and it's more these like gross trends. that's one of the reasons why i like b to be in prosumer softwhere that certainly comes to each individual represents a larger share of your revenue. But then you're actually much more likely to have a relationship with them. Usually they're comfortable with saying, i hate it. And allso that.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nBut that's one of the reasons why i like b to be in prosumer softwhere that certainly comes to each individual represents a larger share of your revenue, so you can care about the more, if that's the way to put it. But then you're actually much more likely to have a relationship with them. You know, there's folks that it, we've had as customers, stretching all the way back to those early days, and they've written him with lots of great feedback, and we've had our back and forth. And so then, you know, it's pretty natural to go and say, h chi, cotour new websay. What do you think? And allso that. Usually they're comfortable with saying, i hate it. Here's why, which is important. And of course, you can do that with consumer stuff. Think it is harder. The scale is bigger. The individuals matter less, and it's more these like gross trends. Speaking about numbers a little bit, i thinke another question that i like to make sure to ask on teams is, why are we doing this? Hopefully that should go with anything you ever do in a company. But i think you can take it, especially folks who have been n marketing a long time, take it as just given that you need to launch. And i actually do kind of agree with that. You can't expect people to know about your product if you haven't launched it, a sort of, how i'd put it, unless you have some viral growth loop thing that's really, you know, quite remarkable. But for the most part, you got to get some real effort into getting out ([Time 0:14:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e981999e-cec7-44df-96e5-243bf70a1269)) #status/review \n\n*In consumer software each user is worth very little*\n*In business to business software you can afford to spend more time and effort on each user*\n*You can't expect users to know about your product if you don't launch it*\n*You can't expect people to know about your project if you don't promote it*\n\n---\n\nI think we did a pretty good launch\nSummary:\nIf we have a successful two point o launch, we're basically telling the world, no, he a memetic. That's gontd of my intoish about how this works. But actually, i do think there is an excellent internal reason that exists for almost any launch, which is, basely, energizing the team. Really something about seeing, again, that's that moment.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nI think we did a pretty good success with our one point o meam seed, and i think if we have a successful two point o launch, we're basically telling the world, no, he a memetic. Diana, up date here. We got e new and up dated things that we're saying about mew that has new capabilities. We have new ways to describing yet. We have new words and phrases. And because we are the memetic source in a way now, obviously through the product itself, but also through our web sight and how we talk about it in our twitter and so forth, that will then tend to propagate through the social networks, which is where people get most of theirinformation these days. That's gontd of my intoish about how this works.\nSpeaker 1\nNow, no other sorts of success metric, of course, can be things like new users, or putting one point o on a product convinces people who are already using it that it's sort of stable and trustable, that stuff. But you earlier, you mentiond and a not being too external facing in your description of what a launch is. But actually, i do think there is an excellent internal reason that exists for almost any launch, which is, basely, energizing the team. Oh, yehr. Really something about seeing, again, that's that moment. But a conversation, and again, it can be in a small circle. It can be a hacker news thread. It can be a couple of twitter threads. It can be common son product hunt. It can comments on a uto video for some person that decided to review your product, whatever it is. ([Time 0:20:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c4832e31-6e96-4bcc-8899-9462cc769417)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nShipping a Product\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nThe milestone aspect of it, i'm a huge fan of kind of milestones in general. As a life hack, is not quite it a technique one can use in your personal life and your company, in your family, which is yooit's very easy that the days pass day by day by day, and you're doing all the things you're doing, your very heads down and focused on the details. And i like milestones that cause us to zoom out and look at the bigger picture. Maybe birthdays, and, i don't know, holidays served that and personal life. But in companies and products, i think that shipping a product is one of the important milestones, and something you make happen, and then you get this result that you see of what you put into the world, which is sometimes bigger and smaller. Every launch goes differently. You can't totally predict it. There is certainly a big element of, call it luck or randomness, in terms of how it will be received. But the fact that you did this together, you pulled together, you had the singular purpose. It all comes down to kind of eighten to one day, or a couple of days. And then afterwards, you can have that shared celebration. That's a really powerful thing.\nSpeaker 2\nAnd i think sometimes you got to basicly manufacture it a little bit t'. Thextent that ou're artificially manufacturing is not going to be an external product launched, necessarily. But i think humans creator s tha this natural rhythm where every maybe every four to six years, you want a big change, like you start o ccompany, you join new company, something like that. And every two, four, six months, you ned a cut a wind, like a fuature level win. And every week or two you need a get commit level win, or whatever. And if for whatever reason you're not getting that, which can happen if you're working on especially these big enterprise products that basicy go on forever, like you're never done, you got to manufacture and say, all right, this is version seven point two.

For example, this feeling of accomplishment and team identity can absolutely be magnified by doing an internal proc launch. Tot's something you don't get to until you're medium size or larger, where you have dedicated internal teams. But how on' y pry hit this round 50 or a hundred people or so? I always found that very focusing and rewarding to articulate to the company what you've done,. why and what benefits theyre gon frentyou have.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nAnd did you find being in that horizontal roll and part of a much bigger team, was that more or less or the same in terms of satisfaction for getting your work into the hands of and users? I mean, in some ways, maybe your customers, so to speak, wor internal ones, rit like building internal tools. You could still, i guess, you do releases. You're not going to do a big press launch, necessarily. But if you have a hundred people in the company using your internal tool, you might need to do some kind of announcement, try to get people excited and get them to bridge the gap from the old world to the new.\nSpeaker 2\nYes, that's an interesting angle.

And sometimes it's just a really fast computer, but it's sort of really kind of more up to you. And in that sense, you know, closer to being a freelancer, you need that ability to make decisions about okay, I'm going to spend this money for equipment in order to maximize my productivity, as well as my just comfort enjoyment at the job. And then it'd be remiss if I didn't mention an idea here that comes from Hillary Maloney, someone we collaborated with a little while back, who had this concept of a work idealist. And she actually discovered this in looking through our customer feedback and kind of some different surveys and things and trying to understand the kind of person that wants to use and purchase Muse. I found this so interesting. I would not have in any way zoomed in on this and thinking about our target customer, but she defined it as someone who is not doing the work, just for the paycheck, if that's the right way to put it, but they're driven to be in tech or a creative field of some kind because they feel they could find a lot of meaning there and they want to bring their strategic skills, their creativity, their intellect to the table to work on something they find intellectually interesting, challenging, meaningful. Obviously, it's a great privilege of being in a field where your skills are in demand to be able to kind of go higher up the Maslow's hierarchy, I guess, in the work you're doing.

And we've tried using these products ourselves internally for team planning and things like that, including exactly Milano, Miro, FigJam, Apple's got freeform now. There's a long tail of these that we've tried out. And yeah, they never really, in some cases, I'm like, oh, that's pretty neat. But they don't really stick. I don't find myself wanting to come back to them or reference it again. You certainly can't use them. In some cases, it literally can't use them. But perhaps you just see they aren't built for personal thinking. So I'm never sure what to think when I try out a product like this, but it doesn't really stick for me. Does that make me go, huh, maybe this whole idea of an infinite canvas with multiplayer capability is not as useful as I would have thought. Maybe we shouldn't bother to build it. But the other interpretation is more the now famous story of what the Dropbox founder told investors when they asked him, why are you building this? There's hundreds of products that purport to do this exact same thing in the market. And he basically says, well, do you use any of them? And they say, no. And he says, well, that's because no one's done it right yet. I'm going to do it right. And indeed, he did. So whether views can be as useful and successful as Dropbox is remains to be seen. But one of my takeaways for me is like, okay, there's something there with those products. And indeed, I have used some of them somewhat extensively.

And indeed, a lot of when we think of collaborative tools, like a Google Docs, we are thinking of that very real time nature. You're seeing someone typing in the document. But I think for sure, a big part of having good ideas and developing them over time is the, like you said, the taking a walk. And that has this asynchronous or spread out across time. You often have talked about things like letting stuff stew or feeding your sleeping mind and you literally sleep on the problem and come up with another idea. And I think there's a version of that within a group as well, bouncing ideas back and forth in a kind of virtual sense. And that's a very interesting overlap with something that I think is a big part of the emerging best practices around remote work, which is embracing asynchronous.

And I'm not surprised that it's come from Antoine, one of our earliest and best customers. I almost challenged the kind of framing that you had of how do we get people who are currently using disparate tools to use a more unified approach, which I'm sure is probably one personally likes and approves. So the question could actually mean different things. It could mean how do we help the group converge on a tool or set of tools, or it could be how do you manage the chaos and complexity of people using different tools? And I think there's different answers to both those. Maybe we can take the framing of how do we get some convergence? I have a couple thoughts here. One is a very powerful truism that I heard about management is people don't show up to work to do a bad job. It's one of those that sounds so simple when you say it, but it's very easy to catch yourself basically making that implicit assumption. So why are these people coming in to work using old tools? There's some reason. So you got to have some curiosity about what their context is, what their personal history is, why they think this is the best way for them to do a good job. So I counsel curiosity there, which is hard to take much further without additional context on the team, but that's one idea. Another sort of management pattern that I might advise here is starting with a single person. So often people present these leadership challenges of there's this group, and I want the group to do something different. Why can't group X? The thing is groups don't do things. People do things. So the way to start is to find one individual human being and to convince them and help them have success with a new path. And this actually has several important benefits.

We've found that many users, many people love to write that way also and they're not writing for Twitter. So I think by, in a way, by chance, we stumbled on a really interesting idea, a novel way of writing. That's helpful even when you are not targeting Twitter.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nI'm investing in it like I do with any piece of writing, and it feels like a very weird thing to be just doing this and this little pop up text area box. And so they're clearly not a dedicated writing tool. And so it just feels a very natural thing to say, let's make a, yeah, I don't know, if you want to think of it as a word processor, that's not quite right, but there are a lot of dedicated text tools that exist for others. Types of writing we want to do in our lives, and that can be a first class thing, managing that over time and making the writing experience good and having multiple drafts, collaborating with other people, and really something like Twitter is a publishing platform. The little text area they give you for typing your text just increasingly to me does it feel quite up to the job of at least the way that some folks use Twitter.\nSpeaker 2\nYeah, also because in a way it's a completely different form of writing, this idea of atomic atomic writing, writing these short snippets that somehow are connected together, but they are their own thing. We've found that many users, many people love to write that way also and they're not writing for Twitter. So I think by, in a way, by chance, we stumbled on a really interesting idea, a novel way of writing. That's helpful even when you are not targeting Twitter.

Many people are in a way using social media to attract people to platform they own. I think our friend and a multiple guest on the podcast, Jeffrey Lit, is being very good at this.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nYeah, you can see the whole evolution of writing on the internet, things getting easier and easier with the next meeting one after the other, starting from blogging. In a way, I'm still very attached to blogging makes me really nostalgic when it's a really good blog. I try to keep one myself. But yeah, I think blogging is still going today. And we see many of our users keeping personal blogs and repartusing the same content also on Twitter and medium. In a way, a blog is this platform you'll know that nobody can take away from you. It's very common today to see creators still owning a blog with an attached newsletter as a way to own their audience. Many people are in a way using social media to attract people to platform they own. And that's I think the role blogs and newsletters play today.\nSpeaker 1\nThat makes sense. I think our friend and a multiple guest on the podcast, Jeffrey Lit, is being very good at this.

So it was surprisingly natural because I had developed this relationship to the founders over a long period of time, very gradually, very organically just through chatting with them and reporting various bugs with the app and building some community contributions and things like that. So it was surprisingly easy and very natural. It was just really like, instead of spending a few hours here and there working on Obsidian every week, what if I was just doing that full time? And I do think it's a, at least in my mind, when I was thinking about what's next after Lumia, my default would have been to start another company, but I couldn't think of anything that I thought was more exciting than Obsidian. And so that, to me, at least in my own head, it says a lot. I don't know if it says a lot to other people, but it does say a lot that I would rather kind of go and help build this thing, which I think is such an amazing app and community, than try to start another thing from scratch right now.\nSpeaker 2\nYeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I think that entrepreneurship, you shouldn't start with, I want to start a company. You should start with, I want to solve a problem or have an impact on the world or go to a place where I can contribute the most. Really starting a company should be your last resort. If there's really no other way to accomplish. I agree. That's a great point. What you want to do, then you say, well, damn it. I guess I have to start a company.

And partially I like this term for a lot of reasons comes up, but it's also a back reference to one of our first guests we ever had on the podcast, Andy Matchak will link that in the show notes. But you have a great blog post titled evergreen notes turn ideas into objects you can manipulate.\nSpeaker 1\nYeah, evergreen, I think that Andy's notes about that that he's published are really great. And what I like about my definition is just turning an idea into a memorable chunk of text, but memorable to you, like a meme that is a meme inside of your own thinking. How can you take an idea that you had or read and turn it into a memorable chunk? Like sometimes I think what we love about good quotes from like famous people or from books is that they are in a way and evergreen note because they take a feeling or a concept and turn it into this like memorable little chunk of text. And at least in the way that I write for my own personal thinking, having that little chunk of text, like you said, everything is a remix. That's an evergreen note in my system. And I can use that in the context of a sentence that might start with because *everything is a remix*, you know, this thing that I found is interesting for that reason. And I use everything as a remix as a link in that sentence. ([Time 0:23:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0afebc94-0783-410b-8e88-0f23cfe1cda2)) \n\n---\n\nThe Power of Writing Things Down to Free Up Mental Space\nKey takeaways:\n- Writing down ideas allows for rapid combination and manipulation of new concepts\n- Breaking down ideas into smaller pieces allows for building more complex thoughts with a stable foundation\n- Writing things down frees up mental space and allows for more capacity to do things manually\n- Automating tasks can open up capacity for manual processes, similar to writing down ideas freeing up mental capacity\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 3\nYeah, that's been my experience too. Or at least I think you can fool yourself into thinking that you can manipulate these things in your head because you can hold what seven things in your head. It's like, oh, look, I have seven things on my head and I can even combine them in different ways. But it's sort of false because once you write down 20 or 30 things and have them as discrete objects, that's when you have the ability to rapidly play with new combinations. It's one of those things that works unreasonably well, just writing it down because it takes it out of your head and it frees up one of those seven slots to put something in and it makes it possible for you to quickly pick up new objects to put in those seven slots from your written down items.\nSpeaker 1\nYeah, and if you can break your ideas down into smaller and smaller pieces, you can also build up more complex ideas that you feel have a stable foundation. Like you can build ideas on top of each other into thinking more complex thoughts than you could otherwise think, which I think is exciting. That's really fun. Yeah.\nSpeaker 3\nThis idea of being able to build up more complex thoughts because you've written them down, it reminds me of this idea of automation and programming where sometimes it feels like you don't really need to automate it because it's basically going fine when you do it manually, which again, it's true as as far as it goes. But really what happens is you have some capacity to do stuff manually. So if you automate it, you can add your manual stuff on top of that. So you basically open up the ceiling to be able to do more stuff as a computer user. It kind of has the same feeling to me as this idea of [writing stuff down to free up more mental space](../writing%20stuff%20down%20to%20free%20up%20more%20mental%20space.md).

I mean, one is I think that from a user perspective, putting aside how long of a duration you expect or want or would be desirable in your data, your work, the things you've created. Ultimately, I think, especially here talking about creators, people using tools or productivity software to make things, you really care about your work, not the tool. And obviously people can get excited about the hot new tool and they do and that's a lot of fun. But ultimately I care about when I'm using a piece of video editing software to edit a video or I'm using a word processor to write my PhD dissertation, I care about what I'm creating way, way more than the tool itself. But as software creators, as tool makers, it's very easy to have a certain kind of ego-centrism, which is the tool is the important part. Or maybe this even just comes from programmers where we think, well, the program is the complicated, interesting, important part. ([Time 0:36:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4a435b62-3d3b-4095-a968-0448113eefce))\n*The work is more important than the tool*\n\n---\n\nUser Perspective: Caring About the Work, Not the Tool\nKey takeaways:\n- Users prioritize their work over the tools they use.\n- Ego-centrism among software creators can lead to a misguided focus on tools.\n- Understanding the user perspective is crucial for software creators.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nAnd it touches on a few things of very much of interest to me.

Or maybe this even just comes from programmers where we think, well, the program is the complicated, interesting, important part. And all those bits we write to disk on behalf of the user, that's kind of a secondary thing. But I think the user perspective is really the inverse of that. ([Time 0:36:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c8fa2497-b696-4a4a-9221-9286a7d28fe2))\n*The work is more important than the tool*\n\n---\n\nTools for Thought and the Future of Creation\nKey takeaways:\n- The term 'tools for thought' sometimes prioritizes the tool over the thought\n- There is a sense of something significant happening in the field of tools for thought\n- New tools are being invented and society is making important decisions regarding them\n- These tools have the potential to unlock new thoughts and accelerate creative output\n- Consideration should be given to how the ideas and creations produced by these tools can be preserved and endure over time\n- We are at a turning point, similar to the printing press, where we can design these tools to achieve these goals\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nYeah, and I think that's why the term tools for thought kind of rubs me the wrong way sometimes because it's putting the tool at a higher level of importance than the thought in a weird way. And I think that the question that I'm wondering about is like, what are we doing on a civilizational level? When I say we, like everyone who's involved in making and using tools for thought right now, what's happening right now? Because it does feel like there's something brewing, there's like something that's happening right now in this area that hasn't, for some reason, it wasn't happening 10 years ago or 20 years ago, it seems to be happening right now. And I do think we're inventing some interesting new tools, and we're making some interesting decisions about society or humanity in some way. And I feel like the things that we've been kind of talking about in this conversation are the things that we're doing. We're trying to unlock a way that people can have thoughts that they haven't had before. Like maybe some of these tools can open up ideas and allow people to think more complex thoughts or accelerate their progress towards some sort of creative output that they wouldn't have otherwise been able to get to without these tools. So that seems kind of cool and important. And then the other part is how did those ideas or creations or whatever you made, the outputs of the tool last for a long time, hopefully? I mean, maybe you make something very ephemeral and it's not meant to last for a long time and that's fine. But if you want them to be able to, they should. And I think that we're at a turning point, like the printing press or something where we have the opportunity to kind of design these tools to hopefully pursue at least one or both of those goals.

The output is the idea that you wouldn't have had, as you said. And there may be pragmatically something where, again, you're working on your PhD dissertation or your grand idea or your software product or whatever it is, and the thinking tools help you to achieve that. And maybe you're copy-pasting some things out of it. And the way to me, it's almost a feature that whatever it is, that plaintext file, that canvas or whatever form, the thinking space is taking, or even going to the physical world, right, the whiteboard or this sketchbook. It's sort of a feature that my sketchbook, I can't turn that into the finished artifact because the sketchbook is the place to have loose thoughts in a way that's open-ended, that's safe and private, that is just messy and combinatorial. And then when I feel like, okay, I've had the aha moment, this is the thing I need to say or do, now I'm going to move to those more kind of production tools. But that can seem confusing, I think, in some cases, because it sort of seems like you're doing extra work and why.

But that can seem confusing, I think, in some cases, because it sort of seems like you're doing extra work and why. And I think of it as you're doing the work you're already doing in your head, but you're doing it through this externalized form, as you said earlier, and that that is a help, even though it may, in a sense of what it looks like to an external person, look like I'm doing more work. But you have to do the thinking either way with or without the help, with or without the aid. And then there's also that, how do you turn this into like a more production thing for consumption by other people or execute that idea? And that should just be a separate set of tools.\nSpeaker 1\nIt is hard to be messy in a digital form.

Comprehensive difficulty relates to understanding the rules of the game while executive difficulty is about physicality (e.g. fast reflexes, coordination). Strategic difficulty relates to how to use your understanding of the rules and your reflexes to best master the game, your opponent, or yourself.\n\n---\n\nArs Technica’s Kyle Orland listed “five noncomprehensive subcategories” of gaming difficulty. Mechanical difficulty is about reflexes, punishing difficulty relates to how much of penalty you pay for mistakes (e.g. does the game make you start from the beginning when you die), arcane difficulty is about how much the game helps you learn to play, grindable difficulty is about the game giving you an option to power up via spending a lot of time performing tedious actions, and difficulty walls is about the presence of “impassable walls that fully impeded a player’s progress\n\n---\n\nEven the hardest mountain can be ground down by a gentle stream if given enough time. Similarly, some games that seem tough at first can eventually be completed if you’re willing to put in the time to grind out improvements to your character’s power level.\nIn a game like Super Meat Boy, there’s no item you can find to make a difficult series of jumps any easier. In Elden Ring, on the other hand, the game can become significantly easier as you put in more time collecting the runes and items needed to power up your character level, weapons, and spells.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.098931098-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/A-Time-Blocking-Comparison-Sunsama-vs.-Fantastical":{"title":"A Time Blocking Comparison Sunsama vs. Fantastical","content":"\n# A Time Blocking Comparison: Sunsama vs. Fantastical\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://thesweetsetup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sunsama-Fantastical-Timeblocking-1.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Josh Ginter*\n* Full Title: A Time Blocking Comparison: Sunsama vs. Fantastical\n* URL: https://thesweetsetup.com/a-time-blocking-comparison-sunsama-vs-fantastical/\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\n• What do you want to get done today?\n• How long will each thing take you to complete?\n• [What can wait for another day?](../What%20can%20wait%20for%20another%20day%3F.md)\n• How do you want the most important tasks structured in your calendar?

All good visual designers deeply understand this effect.\nIn UX design we have a cognitive equivalent. If you have two buttons, there is a third ‘object’ created, the decision a user must make on which button to tap.

At that point, you can hit “Enter,” and it will do it. But not only that, it will also teach you the keyboard shortcut for next time. So, you start up this mastery curve.

And TV is a lean-back experience. Now, with console gaming, it really does depend on the game. You’re probably not going to play “Call of Duty” leaning back. But you might play “Animal Crossing” that way.\nAnd so as a product designer, I think there’s just a set of questions you have to answer.\nAre you building a lean-back versus a lean-forward experience? How do you want people to feel? What is the primary thing you’re optimizing for? Is it the feeling of power? Well, then, you’re going to want to let customers remap their keys and run things their own way.

And even at Facebook, the most viral company of all time, they were not able to sustain 0.7 for more than about seven months.”\nAt the end of the day, it always comes down to word-of-mouth organic spread, it comes down to brand, it comes down to building a product that people love.

Number one, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be so expensive that you just wouldn’t buy it? Number two, what price would you consider Superhuman to be priced so low that you would feel the quality wouldn’t be very good, and that would be concerning? Number three, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be starting to get expensive so that it is not out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it and you still would? And number four, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be a bargain, a great buy for the money?\nNow, most Silicon Valley companies orient around question number four, the bargain question. And that’s because most tend to be selling into a new market or a new buyer in an existing market. But for us, it made sense to adopt that premium position.

It’s just that the complexity and the configurability were so strong that the companies almost lost sight of the fact that it should be enjoyable to use.

At that point, you can hit “Enter,” and it will do it. But not only that, it will also teach you the keyboard shortcut for next time. So, you start up this mastery curve.

And TV is a lean-back experience. Now, with console gaming, it really does depend on the game. You’re probably not going to play “Call of Duty” leaning back. But you might play “Animal Crossing” that way.\nAnd so as a product designer, I think there’s just a set of questions you have to answer.\nAre you building a lean-back versus a lean-forward experience? How do you want people to feel? What is the primary thing you’re optimizing for? Is it the feeling of power? Well, then, you’re going to want to let customers remap their keys and run things their own way.

No feature or product has ever really had a viral loop of greater than one for any meaningful period of time. Even at LinkedIn the address book import has had a viral factor of 0.4. And even at Facebook, the most viral company of all time, they were not able to sustain 0.7 for more than about seven months.”\nAt the end of the day, it always comes down to word-of-mouth organic spread, it comes down to brand, it comes down to building a product that people love.

Number one, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be so expensive that you just wouldn’t buy it? Number two, what price would you consider Superhuman to be priced so low that you would feel the quality wouldn’t be very good, and that would be concerning? Number three, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be starting to get expensive so that it is not out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it and you still would? And number four, at what price would you consider Superhuman to be a bargain, a great buy for the money?\nNow, most Silicon Valley companies orient around question number four, the bargain question. And that’s because most tend to be selling into a new market or a new buyer in an existing market. But for us, it made sense to adopt that premium position. And the price points that most directly supports the premium position comes out of the third question, when does it feel expensive, but you’d still buy it anyway? For us, the median answer to that third question was $30 a month, and that’s how we picked our price.\nOnce ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm6cj756j69zqrjb92xkn343)) #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.199046229-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/AI-and-Consciousness-James-and-Mia-in-Conversation":{"title":"AI and Consciousness - James and Mia in Conversation","content":"\n# AI and Consciousness - James and Mia in Conversation\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fpodcast_uploaded_nologo%2F31786786%2F31786786-1664910238499-e92ae0ae1fbb7.jpg\u0026w=100\u0026h=100)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Tools For Thinking by Betaworks*\n* Full Title: AI and Consciousness - James and Mia in Conversation\n* URL: https://share.snipd.com/episode/a209fbb5-4093-477b-b75b-48edc54a97c7\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nThe Future of Consciousness\nKey takeaways:\n(\\* The brain computer interface will become more sophisticated, allowing us to train ourselves to let go of thoughts., * The brain computer interface will allow us to understand ourselves better and know our values.)\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nAnd not just because we've written it down, but because we now have an intelligence that reflects our values and understands us and knows us deeply, that can help us work through it and like different time. And so some of those threads, right, when we think about some of those threads maybe be like, shit, I really need to be a better boss next week and not be so short with the person I'm managing. But that might be right next to like, I really don't understand what it means to have meaning in life. That's what it's like to be a conscious being is like you're constantly cycling from these like super reflective, like, metacognitive thoughts about existence to like, I'm hungry and I need to eat. And so I feel that as brain computer interfaces grow more and more sophisticated and we're able to interact with machines directly with our thoughts, which are composed of language at their base level, then we'll be able to train ourselves to when our brain generates something, just let go of it. Because it will, and we can kind of deal with it on our own time, and we'll be able to build a ([Time 0:21:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e8ee825c-b41f-4df5-97d3-649765ea8fd4))\n\n---\n\nTools for Thinking\nKey takeaways:\n(\\* Language is the tool for thinking, and it can be used to improve relationships and the world around us., * We can use language to better understand ourselves and others, and this will lead to better relationships and a better world.)\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nI think on an interpersonal level and a societal level, we'll have these types of dialogues for everything, not just we'll just be able to start moving those thoughts into shared systems that have models that are trained on helping us solve the latest new problem we have as humans. And ideally there will be less of them and there'll be less severe because we'll be better at working together because we'll understand ourselves better. And I guess at a high level, it's a speed back loop of a greater level of self understanding driven by like a quieter mind. It's driven by more self expression that translates into better relationships in a better world is the most optimistic you can think of it.\nSpeaker 2\nJohn, what does this bring up for you?\nSpeaker 3\nSo I think a bunch of things. So one is that I think, in the topic of this podcast is tools for thinking. And I think that it gives Andy Marshshak who referred to language as the tools for thinking, the original tool for thinking.

Do I have other than Andy West, my passport? Do I still need vaccine cards or that crap, right? So I have all that sort of like going on in back. And that is like in turn, giving me a degree of, I'm not sure what we call it, anxiety or just like sort of like I've got a bunch of things I need to do. So that's how I'm showing up right now. And by externalizing that and making that into, you know, a dialogue with either with you or with my second voice, I think that that actually can help me be a better person.\nSpeaker 1\nI think that's the metaphor of monologue into dialogue and something like a really important part of the way that we talk about this and communicate about this. Because it allows us, you know, I think one of the goals here is that like John can get all of the benefits of when he's having a particularly challenging day talking through the way that he's feeling with his wife as an example without constantly texting his wife every time he was a thought.

List making was the death of creativity! I think a lot of creative people look at lists like that. But here is the thing: They are the natural part of any project of scale, and a logical list combined with a system of checkboxes will bring order to even the most unruly and complex project.\n\n---\n\nThe value of a list is that it frees you up to think more creatively, by defining a project’s scope and scale for you on the page, so your brain doesn’t have to hold on to so much information.\n[The value of a list is that it frees you up to think creatively](../The%20value%20of%20a%20list%20is%20that%20it%20frees%20you%20up%20to%20think%20creatively.md)\n\n---\n\nThe story genius Andrew Stanton, who cowrote the Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. franchises and directed both Finding Nemo and Finding Dory for Pixar, talked to me about this first pass at listing out the component parts of a project. He was consulting with a group recently, and they were working on the early stages of a project when he said to them, “Can we just all agree right now, this is going to suck? Whatever we’re talking about now, no matter how much we’re getting excited, let’s just all understand it’s going to be a mess.” They were shocked, wondering if he was insulting the project itself. He explained that no, he was simply letting them know that in a project with any amount of complexity, the early stages won’t look at all like the later stages, and he wanted to take the pressure off any members of the group who may have thought that quality was the goal in the early stages.\n[Sacrificial List](../Sacrificial%20List.md)\n\n---\n\nMark Frauenfelder, founding editor in chief of Make magazine, insists that “you’ve got to do at least six iterations, minimum, of any project before it starts getting good enough to share it with other people.” That very first iteration, what I call the brain dump, Mark calls “the quick and dirty stuff.”\n\n[Sacrificial List](../Sacrificial%20List.md)\n\n---\n\nStep 2 is to take that massive list and start to carve it into manageable chunks. #status/review \n\n---\n\nStep 4: Diving In I almost never begin at the beginning. Usually I examine the subcategorized list and I look for the toughest nut to crack. The real ass-kicker of a problem. The one for which I have the most difficulty imagining a solution at first glance. #status/review \n\n---\n\nStep 6: Put It Away for a Bit #status/review \n\n---\n\nI frequently abandon projects, for various reasons. Life, travel, TV shows, more important projects—there are lots of reasons that I’ll shelve some projects. Not permanently, but they’ll lie dormant for periods of anywhere from days to sometimes years. In those cases, I find it handy to make a list of exactly where I stand with that particular build: what I’ve gotten done; what I was planning to do next; what is needed for the next steps. Checkboxes here are vitally important, particularly for when I’m ready to come back to a project. I want to feel like I’ve made meaningful headway before taking a second crack at something, and seeing all those colored-in checkboxes really helps. #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.053376709-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Adding-Intention-to-Spaced-Repetition":{"title":"Adding Intention to Spaced Repetition","content":"\n# Adding Intention to Spaced Repetition\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://s3.amazonaws.com/readwiseio/2021/08/unnamed-2.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Daniel Doyon*\n* Full Title: Adding Intention to Spaced Repetition\n* URL: https://blog.readwise.io/adding-intention-to-spaced-repetition\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nIn Japanese martial art tradition, there is a concept known as **Shu Ha Ri**.

When we do put a name to non-rational behaviour, it is usually a word like ‘emotion’, which makes it sound like logic’s evil twin. ‘You’re being emotional’ is used as code for ‘you’re being an idiot’. If you went into most boardrooms and announced that you had rejected a merger on ‘emotional grounds’, you would likely be shown the door.

Why do we care? Because it’s confusing af - Apple’s lineup of iPads is confusing, with 5 different iPads at different price points with different storage configuration options. You’re going to be living with this iPad for at least a few years, so you want to make the right choice.\n* Eg: How to type really fast. Why are we talking about it? Well, obviously typing makes up such a ridiculously large part of most people’s lives, socialising, work etc. If we can improve our typing speed from X to Y, or by Z%, it has so many benefits to our productivity, but also to our creativity (speed of thought = speed of typing) and to our relationships (you can reply to friends and emails faster…) \\\u003c- this last point would be said a bit tongue-in-cheek ([View Highlight](https://aliabdaal.notion.site/Script-Template-52b0a8bdc7114ab5859611d4d3d96388?__readwiseLocation=0%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F1%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F1%2F1%2F0%2F0%2F37%2F0%2F0%2F3%2F0%2F0%2F1%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F4%3A1%2C0%2F0%2F0%2F1%2F0%2F3%2F1%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F1%2F1%2F0%2F0%2F37%2F0%2F0%2F3%2F0%2F0%2F1%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F4%3A460#:~:text=ake%20a%20step%20back%20-%2Cbe%20said%20a%20bit%20tongue-in-cheek))\n* What is the *Why behind the Why* of our topic or video?\n\n### Research\n\n* How's this concept doing on YouTube?\n  * How \"Worth it\" is this video to make?\n    * This shouldn't prevent us from doing the video, but likely sets an idea of what the upward limit is\n* Any videos outperforming relative to their subscribe count?\n  * What's special about this?\n    * What are their titles and thumbnails?\n    * What's the video actually like?\n    * Anything we can leverage here?\n* Establish a target audience for the video\n\n### Hook / Intro\n\n* Your hook should in the first 4 seconds re-confirm what the title promised the view. \n* In the first 15 seconds, establish the video's [essential question](../essential%20question.md) /  [point of tension](../point%20of%20tension.md)\n* In the first 20 seconds establish how this video is going to provide unique value to the viewer by resolving the [point of tension](../point%20of%20tension.md)\n* *Signposting* — making it clear the parts of the video at the start.

But I had misunderstood. Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what's not working. We all have lots of ideas, creations and projects. When you present one to the world and it's not a hit, don't keep pushing it as is. instead get back to improving and inventing. Don't waste years fighting uphill battles against locked doors. Improve or invent until you get that huge response (Page 11)\n\n---\n\nHow do you grade yourself?\nFor me, it's how many useful things I create, whether songs, companies, articles, websites, or anything else. If I create something that's not useful to others, it doesn't count. But I'm also not interested in doing something useful unless it needs my creative input.\nHow do you grade yourself?\nIt's important to know in advance, to make sure you're staying focused on what's honestly important to you, instead of doing what others thing you should (Page 37)\n\n---\n\nAs a business owner, when you screwed over by someone, you might be tempted to make a big grand policy that you think will prevent you ever getting screwed over again: One employee can't focus and spends his time surfing the Web. Instead of just firing or reassigning that person to more challenging work, the company installs an expensive content-approving firewall so that nobody can go to unapproved sites ever again.\nIt's important to resist that simplistic, angry, reactionary urge to punish everyone, and step back to look at the big picture. (Page 42)\n\n---\n\nYou should feel pain when you're unclear\nWhen writing an email to everyone, if I wasn't perfectly clear, I'd get twenty thousand confused replies, whihc would take my staff all week to reply to, costing me at least $5,000 plus lost morale. Ever if I was very clear but took more than a few sentences to explain something, I'd get thousands of replies from people who never read past the first few sentences. Writing the email to customers-carefully eliminating every unnecessary word, and reshaping every sentence to make sure it could not be misunderstood-would take me all day. One unclear sentence? Immediate $5,000 penalty. Ouch. Unfortunately, people writing websites don't get this kind of feedback. Instead, if they're not clear, they just get silence. (Page 46)\n\n---\n\nWhen you're thinking of how to make your business bigger, it's tempting to try to think all the big thoughts and come up with world-changing massive-action plans. But please know that it's often the tiny details that really thrill people enough to make them tell all their friends about you. (Page 48)\n\n---\n\nWhen you want to learn how to do something yourself, most people won't understand. They'll assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way.\nBut that's forgetting about the joy of learning and doing. Yes, it may take longer. Yes, it may be inefficient. Yes, it may even cost you millions of dollars in lost opportunities because your business is growing slower because you're insisting on doing something yourself. But the whole point of doing anything is because it makes you happy. That's it! (Page 59)\n\n---\n\nSame Process.\n1. Gather everybody around.\n2. Answer the question and explain the philosophy.\n3. Make sure everyone understands the thought process.\n4. Ask one person to write it in the manual.\n5. Let everybody know they can decide this without me next time. \nAfter two months of this, there were no more questions.

It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=480))\n\n---\n\nImprovements are only temporary until they become part of who you are. The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=488))\n\n---\n\nIt is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=553))\n\n---\n\nIf a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.

It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.” Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=849))\n\n---\n\nIn the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.) But 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate. The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.

So beautiful, in fact, that he immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by his more common possessions. He wrote that there was “no more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of his stuff. Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced his rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to place above the mantel, and a better kitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase led to the next. Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.

Strategies like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1033))\n\n---\n\nPeople often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled with doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to grab one every now and then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1058))\n\n---\n\nHere are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious: If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter. If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand in the middle of the living room. If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack of stationery on your desk. If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and place them in common locations around the house. ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1109))\n\n---\n\nThe same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1116))\n\n---\n\nEnvironment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it. ([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1121))\n\n---\n\nThink in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watches television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different people can have different memories—and thus different habits—associated with the same place. The good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context. ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1131))\n\n---\n\nIf your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1161))\n\n---\n\nThe people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. ([Location 1200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1200))\n\n---\n\nIf you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use.

In Byrne’s case, he bundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the thing he needed to do). ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1371))\n\n---\n\nIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. ([Location 1410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1410))\n\n---\n\nHumans are herd animals.

As Charles Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.” ([Location 1442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1442))\n- Note: C2\n\n---\n\nSurround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself.

It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run. ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1484))\n\n---\n\nWe tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. ([Location 1542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1542))\n\n---\n\nNow, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to. You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities. ([Location 1627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1627))\n\n---\n\nExercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task that drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.” ([Location 1635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1635))\n\n---\n\nYou can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.” ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1645))\n\n---\n\nHighlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.

In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net. After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore.

Like that's the exact out of shit I have. Whenever I'm doing videos, it's It's never that I am the expert teaching you how to do the thing. It's more like, you know, I'm just one of the people, man. I read Austin clear in the book and he said, This thing that I'm learning along the way and therefore I started my blogging my YouTube channel, and, you know, this is kind of fun to join me along the way on, I found that when I when I dig down into the analytics, my videos that have performed by far the best are the ones that start with the phrase how I do something rather than how to do something. Um, had a video \nSpeaker 0: really cool. Yeah, I was really cool. \nSpeaker 1: I had a video recently called. How I type really fast on that went viral has got, like, three million views on.

And so it sounds like with your videos, that's what you're doing, right? You're like, this is how I'm doing this thing. And then people feel like Okay, well, maybe I could try that, but that's how he does it. So how will I do it? Right, So it just I feel like you're so much of teaching and building an audience. And really creating a community is about, you know, ([Time 0:14:58](https://www.airr.io/quote/62bf773d845984cbe96e75a6)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: you know, showing people what you've learned, but also giving them the space to make their own, like adjustment. You know what I mean? The space for them to be creative to. And I think the really great teachers. And I'm sure you found this with your videos. People talk back to you and they're like You'll learn so much from them, right? Because that because that's really the thing that I think about sharing what you're learning. Even if someone tells you you're an idiot, there is usually something you can learn how that interaction. And they're like, Well, you're I remember like I do these things called newspaper blackout poems where I taken article from the newspaper and I black out most of it, and there's just, like a few words behind ([Time 0:15:41](https://www.airr.io/quote/62bf7768845984cbe96e7af0)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: I discovered Tom Phillips that I was like, Okay, well, I'm gonna find out everything there is to know about Tom's work. And then I'm gonna find out everything to know about the people who inspired his work, right? So, like even negative feedback. In a sense, if you could take it in the correct way, you it's just are you gonna learn from it? Right? And so and you know, it's a big But when you share you, you people share back and return. And it's like Christopher Hitchens said that having a book out in the world, it's like having a free education that goes on for a lifetime, you know, because it's just like you put things out into the world. And then they things come back at you, and it's just this big. You know this perpetual cycle?

It's that you find out what you have to say. So that's so like writing every day. Some people say, Oh, you must have so much to say because you write every day and like actually it's the opposite. I have more to say because I sit down and write every day and I figure out what I'm thinking and what it actually is that I have to say. So writing is actually not just a way of communicating with the world. It's actually a way of communicating with yourself because the simple act of sitting down in front of a keyboard ([Time 0:22:43](https://www.airr.io/quote/62bf7952845984cbe96ec281)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: something that you have to do every day you find out it's not that you have something to say.

It's something that for me has always sort of gone by the wayside because there is always it always feels like there is something that is important and urgent rather than writing, which is important and non urgent. Actually, just before, just before speaking to you, I was having a call with this, uh, productivity coach because I thought, Hey, why not? Let's see if this will be good. And the thing we realized is that I just need to carve out an hour every morning and just have that as like, my power hour and just just kind of right in that time on. One thing that you just said now is like, Do \nSpeaker 0: you think it \nSpeaker 1: would be worth just like publishing it on my block under underneath, like my daily journal thing and then maybe just ([Time 0:25:22](https://www.airr.io/quote/62bf79ef845984cbe96edd2d)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: that, like you, sort of get into it, you know, and just have that routine of writing because, man, there's always something more interesting to do than right. I mean, they're like putting air in the tires, like cleaning out your closet or rearranging your books or, you know, doing your taxes. My taxes Never. I'm working on a book. My taxes get done like so quickly It's always something you'd rather do than right. It's even the great writers, you know? I mean, there are some writers that you know they love it and they're really good at. But you know David Rakoff, you know, he said, I'll try to tone this down for YouTube But he ([Time 0:30:38](https://www.airr.io/quote/62bf7b2c845984cbe96f0b2d)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: all day working, first of all, I'm a terrible dad, a terrible spouse friend. I just I'm maniac. But then it's really hard to come down. And if you don't come down, you know there. I really believe in sleep and the process of I think when you sleep, your brain figures out the problems you had the morning before, so I mean, I will always sleep on a manuscript, and often the problem I have you know, one day after a good night's sleep, it gets fixed the next day. Eso I just think little, I really believe in smaller chunks of work over longer periods of time. Okay. Yeah. Then big first. Yeah.

Sounds like a pig at a trough, you know, like you just show up and they just shovel the stuff. You know, where is the searches like searches, mystical searches more like searches more self motivated. And you're putting your tentacles out into the universe. And so I guess my advice to people is to make sure that you're not being fed your interests like and you're actually searching for your interest. And I think one way to do it is to just think about what you wanted to be when you're you. Were we in small? As Alistair Gray says, You know ([Time 0:55:13](https://www.airr.io/quote/62bf8159845984cbe96fda88)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: you're in, does that make sense? So it's like, you know, you love you love punk rock. You love the Clash. But like that was a moment in time. You can't just be the clash. You've gotta, like, do what the clash did. But in your own space, you know? So you have to do a little bit of this, this work of figuring out what you really love about your heroes because I do think that were brought to our work by the work of others. I think that we're you know, we're sort of that's That's how we show up to our own work is that were inspired by the work of others, and that makes us want to do that work. But then you have to update it for your own context, you know? And I think that's the That's the That's the rial artfulness of it. \nSpeaker 1: Yeah, ([Time 1:01:27](https://www.airr.io/quote/62bf8265845984cbe96ff55e)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: that if you look to the natural world, the natural world supplies you with the metaphors that you really need to feel like a whole person. Because plants go dormant in the winter, animals hibernate. In spring, all the work gets done or the, you know things blossom. And then in the fall they're harvested. You know, the thing idea that there are seasons and that there are periods of of frantic activity. And then there's periods of dormancy. And knowing what Susan you're in and and letting it do its work and doing the work appropriate to the season that was, that was, you know, the great that was the great theme of Throw is toe.

Reading the material for yourself is always a valuable thing, no matter who you are on what? \nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's really interesting.

Memories: Experiences from your life that you don’t want to forget. Reflections: Personal thoughts and lessons written in a journal or diary. Musings: Random “shower ideas” that pop into your head.

Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!” In other words, Feynman’s approach was to maintain a list of a dozen open questions. When a new scientific finding came out, he would test it against each of his questions to see if it shed any new light on the problem.

Here’s my own checklist: Capture my current thinking on the project. Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes. Search for related terms across all folders. Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project.

It’s exhausting, isn’t it? Calls and meetings seem to stretch on forever, which means we rarely get to celebrate a clear-cut victory and start fresh. This is one of the best reasons to keep our projects small: so that we get to feel a fulfilling sense of completion as often as possible.

If project is becoming inactive: add a current status note to the project folder before archiving. The fifth step applies only if the project is getting canceled, postponed, or put on hold instead of completed. I still want to archive it so it’s out of sight, but in this special case, there’s one final action I take. I add a new note to the project folder titled “Current status,” and jot down a few comments so I can pick it back up in the future.

What’s the point of knowing something if it doesn’t positively impact anyone, not even yourself? Learning shouldn’t be about hoarding stockpiles of knowledge like gold coins. Knowledge is the only resource that gets better and more valuable the more it multiplies. If I share a new way of thinking about your health, or finances, or business, or spirituality, that knowledge isn’t less valuable to me. It’s more valuable! Now we can speak the same language, coordinate our efforts, and share our progress in applying it. Knowledge becomes more powerful as it spreads.

Convictions were rarely sought and almost impossible to obtain, because they depended entirely on the woman’s own testimony of whether she had felt quickening, and because of the jury’s distaste for prosecuting a woman for exercising her right to choose. In 1800 there was not, so far as is known, a single statute in the United States concerning abortion.

With the rise of a new, university-educated medical elite, anxious to enhance the status and influence of physicians, the [American Medical Association](../American%20Medical%20Association.md) was formed. In its first decade, the AMA began lobbying against abortions performed by anyone except licensed physicians.

Carstensen hypothesizes that the elderly subjects had trained the prefrontal cortex to inhibit the amygdala in the presence of negative stimuli. These elderly subjects were not happier because their life circumstances were better than those of the young subjects; they were instead happier because they had rewired their brains to ignore the negative and savor the positive. By skillfully managing their attention, they improved their world without changing anything concrete about it.

It’s a lose-lose and a waste of everyone’s time. However, if run effectively, meetings can be a powerful tool for team motivation, morale and (you guessed it) productivity. Set a clear agenda for the meeting, and set goals at the end with clear assignments, so everyone knows what they need to do by the next meeting.

But by chipping away at the hard and unpleasant ones first, you’ll get a greater sense of satisfaction in the long term and boost your spirits and self-confidence.

Keep a log of such tasks as soon as you’ve delegated them, or if someone has volunteered to do it. This technique is further strengthened if you log the dates that the task was assigned and its agreed deadline. Avoid creating more admin for yourself by being picky about what is on your waiting-on list (not more than a dozen).

When display scaling is used, the menu bar changes height to ensure it always fits the camera housing. On a 14-inch MacBook Pro the menu bar can be 27pt, 29pt, 34pt, 37pt, or 43pt tall, depending on the display scaling setting. \n\n---\n\nDespite the variation in possible menu bar heights, the working area for menu bar extras is fixed at 22pt, and items can not be taller. A good size for a circular item to feel the same weight as system menu bar items is 16×16pt. Assets can be a different size, provided they’re not taller than 22pt. There should typically not be any padding, unless it is needed to assist with vertical centering. \n\n---\n\nMenu bar extras can be full colour, or monochrome template images. A template image is a standard image, but macOS will ignore the colour, and only use the alpha channel information. Template images are preferred, because they’re automatically tinted to match the system icons in light mode and dark mode, without the need for different assets. \n\n---\n\nApple typically uses 35% opacity to indicate disabled elements. \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.268693988-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Determining-Priority-GTD-Style":{"title":"Determining Priority GTD Style","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article4.6bc1851654a0.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *gettingthingsdone.com*\n* Full Title: Determining Priority GTD Style\n* Category:\n* URL: https://gettingthingsdone.com/2008/08/determining-priority-gtd-style/\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nAs I’ll discuss further in an upcoming post, our brains just aren’t good at carrying around that kind information, or more accurately, they aren’t good at retrieving it when we want it.

But Bill argues that the minute we’re financially secure, we should start focusing on our quality of life, not our bank balance.\n\n---\n\n*The point of life is to accumulate fulfilling experiences*. In an ideal world, we’d simply trade our life energy for fulfilling experiences. That’d be sick. In the real world though, we have the intermediary of needing to make money to survive, and then have those experiences. So we have to trade our life energy - in the form of work - for money.\n\n---\n\nBut it’s a ridiculous notion that we should donate money to our kids on our deathbeds. That’d make the average age of inheritance 60, and when you’re 60, a big windfall isn’t that helpful. But when you’re 25-35, that big windfall is ridiculously helpful. So give money to your kids while you’re still alive.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.137986944-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/E1-Delivering-Pizzas-to-Managing-a-Billion-Dollar-Business-Ben-Francis-Gymshark-CEO":{"title":"E1 Delivering Pizzas to Managing a Billion Dollar Business  Ben Francis Gymshark CEO","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/24367/full_1632384816-artwork.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Deep Dive with Ali Abdaal*\n* Full Title: E1 Delivering Pizzas to Managing a Billion Dollar Business | Ben Francis Gymshark CEO\n* Category:\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/615147f00de4c0000f428717\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: sort of like I dropped out of uni like the week before. Um you know, I was, I was starting to really dig into. I felt like I was then taken, albeit not massive. I didn't feel like massive financial risk, albeit you know, the stand cost everything that we had to fly the Youtubers over everything we had, we'd we've risked everything. We had several times. Um but it was, you know, I just felt really excited about it and the thing that we did well which I'm really proud of is we didn't rest at that point, we did one great event. So then the next year we did to the next year we did five and we just went and went and went and we kept spending everything we had on punts that we thought might come off. But stuff that got told us was the right thing to do. \nSpeaker 1: So between ([Time 0:27:48](https://www.airr.io/quote/615d0d47cceec3ea04ee2d99))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: of questions and we kind of on that white board over there, just like drafted out this structure, which just made so much sense and brought so much clarity. Yeah, I was like, I can't believe how much clarity I've now got in my mind from just drawing this diagram on the board, \nSpeaker 0: so it makes such a difference, but you'll find like when you work with genuinely brilliant people like that, they revolutionized like teams, businesses, brands, everything like so many people talk about all the different nuts and bolts of businesses and brands, but ultimately it's literally just people, it comes down to people and it's so important that you understand how to work with people and you know, work with great people. I am similarly, I was chatting to someone the other week and I was talking about that he was, he worked with one of the most successful business people have sort of like my parents generation and I just said, ([Time 0:49:07](https://www.airr.io/quote/615defa2cceec3ea04bdfa4e))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: they revolutionized like teams, businesses, brands, everything like so many people talk about all the different nuts and bolts of businesses and brands, but ultimately it's literally just people, it comes down to people and it's so important that you understand how to work with people and you know, work with great people. I am similarly, I was chatting to someone the other week and I was talking about that he was, he worked with one of the most successful business people have sort of like my parents generation and I just said, all right, what do they do it in a sentence? Like cut all the bullshit. So I think one sentence, what do they do really well? And they said they attracted great people and then left them alone and I just thought that was so cool and I think, you know, in its most simplistic form, that's what any great entrepreneurial business person does and they do it in different ([Time 0:49:25](https://www.airr.io/quote/615defb4cceec3ea04be01ab))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: you need to be, he genuinely thought I was the right person and incompetent enough to do the role, but I needed to really prove it. Um and the alternative was to hire someone else. Now, fortunately I got to the level of being able to do the role. So two years of making sure I could speak publicly, talk to camera, understand a profit and loss properly understand, you know, long term strategic decisions and working with teams and all that sort of stuff, which again, going to the different chiefs roles that I've done, it gave me incredible grounding across the business, which really helps. And then more recently the official transition started May 1st and it completes august 1st and we're, we're what july now, middle of july. So I'm about two or three weeks away from like officially completing that handover, \nSpeaker 1: so two years worth of kind of like training to be the ([Time 0:52:44](https://www.airr.io/quote/615df07bcceec3ea04be3e14))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: I need to do X, y and z and then I would, I wouldn't, I've never been good at just like Battering something for like 12 hours straight. I would have to do is just a little thing every single day and then having that goal in my head, like the best example I can give was I want to be Ceo, I'm terrible at public speaking, so I need to be, I need to get that Republic speakers, like one of my things was literally public speaking and then I was sort of navigate through life and as I'm an event, whatever on the tube, chatting to people as you go, what do you do for a living? I spoke to someone and they're like, oh, I'm a public speaking coach and normally I'd be like, if I didn't have the goal, it would be nice to have a lovely day, see you soon. But because I had this goal and it was in my list, I'm like, oh my God, I'd love to be great public speaking, Can I take your number? Can we chat some more? Can I learn from you? So this is why I think it's so important to have that goal because then I think it helps yourself ([Time 1:08:38](https://www.airr.io/quote/615e4074cceec3ea04060024))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: in that when you manifest, when you, when you have a goal, like I want to become the Ceo you start seeing the opportunities that you want to seen. \nSpeaker 0: Otherwise you see what you look for. Don't you like the public \nSpeaker 1: speaking thing or you know, when I decided I wanted to buy a Tesla, suddenly I started seeing Tesla's everyone everywhere because you just have that thing and so your brain turns onto the various options here. So I think that's really \nSpeaker 0: cool. Honestly, I'm a massive, massive advocate for that. I think just whatever it is just set a name and the thing is that it's been really powerful for me is I haven't gone, I want to be a ceo, so I'm gonna do these massive things like set the bar so low and it's only now looking back I realized everything I've ever wanted to do, I've set the bar low so jim sharp was started because I wanted to be involved in fitness. The website was built because I wanted the website that would transact, I didn't ([Time 1:10:24](https://www.airr.io/quote/615e40dfcceec3ea04066c29))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: and talking points and then I would look through them with Angus and we would give them the green light. But like really like that one, don't really like this one. Here's some feedback about that one and they would work on the video idea the concept for the next week. And the following monday, we'd have like the full video basically ready. And then I would kind of go through it to be like, okay, if I were actually filming this based on these points, you know, I'd add a story about my life over there, harry potter reference over there, we'll put a story from medicine over there and then the video is ready to film so that when it comes to thursday we can bang bang film for videos \nSpeaker 0: in a day. So when you say bang bang bang, are you talking, would they would, what would you, what would it look like to you? So someone else has come up with an idea you have in a script, you have in key messages that you just having a title, what does that? Yeah, \nSpeaker 1: so title thumbnail and talking points. So bullet points, I don't like reading from a script. It ([Time 1:26:14](https://www.airr.io/quote/615e4554cceec3ea040a236e))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: that one and they would work on the video idea the concept for the next week. And the following monday, we'd have like the full video basically ready. And then I would kind of go through it to be like, okay, if I were actually filming this based on these points, you know, I'd add a story about my life over there, harry potter reference over there, we'll put a story from medicine over there and then the video is ready to film so that when it comes to thursday we can bang bang film for videos \nSpeaker 0: in a day. So when you say bang bang bang, are you talking, would they would, what would you, what would it look like to you? So someone else has come up with an idea you have in a script, you have in key messages that you just having a title, what does that? Yeah, \nSpeaker 1: so title thumbnail and talking points. So bullet points, I don't like reading from a script. It feels very authentic and a \nSpeaker 0: nightmare. Impossible. So \nSpeaker 1: I just like bullet points and the team like overtime, ([Time 1:26:22](https://www.airr.io/quote/615e61a8cceec3ea04234fa7))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: a load of different angles in a low different ways. And it's exactly the way that we and I try and solve problems that jim shakin in life. So I found that book massively inspiring. And then moving around Youtube, I love your channel. You introduced me to notion notion life like genuinely life changing. We I mean we've run almost everything on notion now. Don't wait from a creative point in the entire the entire business by the way, not just as a person. I run. I think you you coined it like a life. Os I have my life O. S. I have a professional life. Different jim shark stuff. Everything from the notion. So that was a life changing to thank you for that. You're very welcome. Yeah, that's it. I just all around the internet Jordan Peterson, I love jane Peterson, a massive, massive fan of him. I think he's brilliant. He's really helped me as well. ([Time 1:32:57](https://www.airr.io/quote/615efa99cceec3ea04acc1c5))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: jane Peterson, a massive, massive fan of him. I think he's brilliant. He's really helped me as well. \nSpeaker 1: I'd love to check out your notion. Set up behind \nSpeaker 0: scenes. That's one of the things that as we're driving out. Yeah, it's \nSpeaker 1: really cool. That \nSpeaker 0: would be, it would be pretty \nSpeaker 1: sick. Um Cool. And any sort of, let's say someone's watching this and they're thinking they're they want to get started being an entrepreneur. Maybe they're sort of Late teens, early 20s haven't really started anything yet, but really inspired by you and your journey. Any kind of \nSpeaker 0: advice you give? Yeah, I mean it's fairly standard, right? You have to do what you love because otherwise you'll end up, you'll end up giving up. I'm a firm believer now that there's no niche too small, especially with the internet being so vast, I always think, and it sounds stupid saying it now, if I'd have said ([Time 1:33:37](https://www.airr.io/quote/615efac0cceec3ea04acddec))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: just think there's no need to small. So I think whatever it is double down on it and just genuinely give it a go. Like, Jim Sharp was the seventh business website product that I've made and the other six failed miserably now. Unfortunately, that's not a sexy story. So no one talks about the failed apps, the failed websites, they only talk about the one that did well and it's a consistent theme on everyone else that successful that I've met. They failed miserably so many times and they've been endlessly optimistic about it and they've just gone again and again and again. \nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think that's one of the things that, like, I, I see this a lot with people starting YouTube channels where there's this sense of, I have to get it right first time. Yeah. And if you look at the stats, like the average YouTube channel takes 152 videos to get to 1000 subscribers. I get messages from people being like, you know, like ([Time 1:34:37](https://www.airr.io/quote/615efafccceec3ea04ad1a1d))\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.071504497-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/E6-the-Science-Behind-Career-Success-Grace-Lordan":{"title":"E6 the Science Behind Career Success  Grace Lordan","content":"\n# E6 the Science Behind Career Success | Grace Lordan\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/24367/full_1632384816-artwork.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Deep Dive with Ali Abdaal*\n* Full Title: E6 the Science Behind Career Success | Grace Lordan\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/617f7959906dc8000f63c118\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: it's really getting down to the nitty gritty of how can we alter decision making in a way that's not paternalistic but is giving people information to help them go in the right direction. \nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, the intent to action gap, I think we've all felt that in our lives like multiple times a day as I was reading this, I started listening to a book about four or five days ago and the very first chapter talks about this idea of me plus I wonder if you can elaborate like what does, what does me plus mean? \nSpeaker 0: So if you, if you go back to the economics were really good, I think making helping ourselves in the present day. So we know what makes us happy in the moment, but very often the things that we have to invest in to give our future selves a better future, we don't often do. So what I like people to do is to think ([Time 0:05:18](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e065d99280c589ea780f28)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: what will that mean plus actually do. Because I've noticed a lot of times when I talk to people about careers, they're attached to a label. So they want to be a trade or an investment banker or they want to be a doctor or they're attached to a lifestyle. So they want to be able to go on a particular vacation or by a particular car and the kind of thing big journey is really thinking about. If I were to be a doctor, if I were to be a trader, what would be the tasks that I would be doing on a day to day basis and would ultimately end up enjoying those tasks? So the activities that I'm going to spend the time in, and there's two reasons for that, so one, it makes you happier to actually do tasks that you like, which feels like a no brainer, but secondly, if you're engaged in tasks that you like, you tend to be more successful and it's the second that I'm really interested in and kind of getting people into jobs where they feel that they've ([Time 0:06:15](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e066099280c589ea781759)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm working for a company that's saving the environment, but I've been treated really badly in a micro culture in order to save that environment. There's a couple of companies come to mind when I think about that um then I'm not going to be productive and I'm not going to be happy and I'm actually likely to leave that that that job. So it's more about going beyond thinking what is the company's mission? What is my personality and what is the micro culture of the team that I'm going to be working in? And will that make me happy? Will I be connected to the mission? Because my team is connected to the mission. \nSpeaker 1: It's very hard to assess in advance when you're applying for a job. \nSpeaker 0: It's really hard. It's really, really hard. And I think that if you bring it down to the tasks and asking in an interview what will I be doing on a day to day basis? Um So when I come to work for you, Ollie, what would I be doing on a day ([Time 0:07:51](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e066689280c589ea78220d)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: the company's mission?

And I think that if you bring it down to the tasks and asking in an interview what will I be doing on a day to day basis? Um So when I come to work for you, Ollie, what would I be doing on a day to day basis? As part of your team? If you can imagine me on a monday, how will I spend my time, the fact that you as a manager have talked about that first, they will tell me that you're a good manager because you know actually what you want the person to do. Um And you're not just hiring blindly? But the second is having that information allows me make my mind up because if the if I like the ([Time 0:08:09](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e0667b9280c589ea7823e2)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: I was excited that the end goal was not 66 pack abs. I was excited that the end goal was that in a way there wasn't an end goal and it was a case of just I want to be able to enjoy this. Um, is that the sort of thing that you get a lot when you're doing this sort of research that process rather than outcome kind of thing. \nSpeaker 0: So I kind of write a lot for kind of people who might have made it yet or people who have plateau. So if you, if you take the exercising analogy from somebody who's contemplating doing the kind of five K run rather than somebody who is contemplating doing the London marathon and it's really well placed for that. And I think for the person who hasn't done exercise for a while or the person who has really invested in their career for a while, the worst thing they can do is do too much. So if you haven't invested for a while, the worst thing you could do is go to the gym for three hours, you might get through it today. But the chances of ([Time 0:09:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e066cf9280c589ea782fbc)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: kind of write a lot for kind of people who might have made it yet or people who have plateau.

So if you haven't invested for a while, the worst thing you could do is go to the gym for three hours, you might get through it today. But the chances of repeating that are really, really small. And I think kind of the, one of the big powerful messages underlining thing, big is whether you're focused on your health or whether you're focused on your career, it's those small actions that you take today will determine yourself in two years time, three years time in four years time and actually by throwing ([Time 0:09:49](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e066de9280c589ea783227)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: and the vibe I got from the chapter around goals is that you're keen on people setting or uh, perhaps not, but like one camp of people in this sphere is encouraging people to set these big, hairy, audacious goals and then figuring out the small steps taken you can, you can take to get there. But then there's another camp and this is sort of where I think I am whereby I think in a way, I feel maybe setting goals is a bit overrated because if you're setting a goal, then \nSpeaker 0: you're \nSpeaker 1: essentially, to me that feels like a contract to be unhappy until you hit the goal and then you hit the goal and then you have this like, fleeting sense of like, oh, I hit a million subscribers, cool, you know, my day to day hasn't really changed, etcetera etcetera. So the way I kind of think ([Time 0:12:20](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e067769280c589ea784a7a)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: of think with the future of work, we have this disruption where people who are able to kind of pivot, know what their skills are job craft, which you, which you've mentioned already. It will really stand to them. \nSpeaker 1: Mm Yeah. So it's like you're moving away from being and more towards doing being a doctor. But versus like what does the day to day of practicing medicine actually look like? And does this sound like the sort of thing that is my idea of fun right now? And I guess, I guess like it's it's kind of, you know, there's that thing in in in the research about it's it's hard for us to predict what will make us happy in the future. \nSpeaker 0: But it's a \nSpeaker 1: reasonable first approximation that the sort of stuff I enjoy doing now, like talking to people like you or like making videos is likely to also probably make me happy in the future. And if it doesn't, then, well, I can just change course, this \nSpeaker 0: is like a grid search. So ([Time 0:16:58](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e0699d9280c589ea789020)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: which one to pick, but like yeah, \nSpeaker 0: so I think for somebody who has no idea what they want to do and who doesn't necessarily have options. It really is about bringing it back to one of the activities that I would like to do and how can I get the skills to actually do those activities and then going about spending time engaged in those activities, So maybe you want to do some more public speaking, you know, trying to get on panels, um trying to spend some time with people who might be actually able to get you into the room where you can do some public speaking in the future, going to talks and studying what Mexico speaker and what doesn't make a good speaker, if you really, really have really have no experience and then maybe there are some skills that you have to pay for and I do say and think big for people who do not know what they want to do, I would avoid committing to a four year degree or an expensive master's program and really use the resources that ([Time 0:20:06](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e06a2d9280c589ea78a6d9)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: about spending time engaged in those activities, So maybe you want to do some more public speaking, you know, trying to get on panels, um trying to spend some time with people who might be actually able to get you into the room where you can do some public speaking in the future, going to talks and studying what Mexico speaker and what doesn't make a good speaker, if you really, really have really have no experience and then maybe there are some skills that you have to pay for and I do say and think big for people who do not know what they want to do, I would avoid committing to a four year degree or an expensive master's program and really use the resources that are out there that are either cheap or free because there's so many things that we can actually learn now without having set foot into a traditional classroom, even though I work in a university and we have wonderful degrees, I think you need to be certain to spend, spend that amount of money and then I think for someone like ([Time 0:20:21](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e06a3b9280c589ea78a9db)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: then maybe there are some skills that you have to pay for and I do say and think big for people who do not know what they want to do, I would avoid committing to a four year degree or an expensive master's program and really use the resources that are out there that are either cheap or free because there's so many things that we can actually learn now without having set foot into a traditional classroom, even though I work in a university and we have wonderful degrees, I think you need to be certain to spend, spend that amount of money and then I think for someone like you, I think doing time orders can really help. So during the week writing down what you're actually doing, which you probably do already, but writing down whether or not you actually enjoy doing them, Did you feel firstly a sense of purpose that it was kind of leading you to a better place in five years time or did you feel fun in the moment and then if there were activities that ([Time 0:20:40](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e06a4e9280c589ea78b8c0)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: are either cheap or free because there's so many things that we can actually learn now without having set foot into a traditional classroom, even though I work in a university and we have wonderful degrees, I think you need to be certain to spend, spend that amount of money and then I think for someone like you, I think doing time orders can really help.

So if you look at the behavioral science literature, a lot of the kind of early ideas will be from bringing students into the lab. It's not scary, like in the 70s, I promise. So, you know, really easy stuff and looking to see whether or not we can change their behavior with a particular insight and then somebody like me brings those insights into companies Into policy and asks is the stuff that's coming out of the students in the lab actually replicating in companies and a lot of times it does. And I would be very honest with you because obviously when we have students in the lab, we have them for a very short period of time when I'm working with workers, I want to know, do the change I make work in the moment one week later, one month later, 12 months later.

Okay. \nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think like there's there's a lot of evidence as you know about how experiencing progress and I think you talk about how to like make your progress more salient, experiencing that sense of progress really is like extremely fundamentally satisfying. Uh And so I guess sometimes if, I think, you know, I guess the standard straw man would be like, oh well you know, if you just play video games all day then it's fun, but it's not like meaningful and I think it's not meaningful because it's not really progressing you forward in a way that adds value to the world, Is that fair to say \nSpeaker 0: or to ([Time 0:36:47](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e2ff00e8cddee92c2e5496)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: that adds value to the world, Is that fair to say \nSpeaker 0: or to yourself? So you know, some people who I meet their values are really about making making money, which is which doesn't bother me. Um but I think that they need to be clear on what the task that they're going to do, that add value to the world. I think I think that I think that's really true and I think finding the kind of right balance of pleasure and purpose is really important, you should play video games if that's something that actually really helps you relax. I think for some people it's been shown that it can be like mindfulness. So again, really thinking about individual differences if playing Mario Kart is what gets you kind of out of the day and into the moment you should spend time on that, but it's balancing that time, so balance the time between serving yourself in the present day and also serving yourself in the future. \nSpeaker 1: And I guess most people's dream job would be one ([Time 0:37:28](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e2ff29e8cddee92c2e5ab3)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: it can be like mindfulness.

And I think as well the kind of adaptation that we feel as humans, it's called hedonic adaptation, Everything that you get you adapt to it really quickly. So whether you get the nicest car, whether you get a pay rise, you know the happiness moments are really fleeting, so if you really are kind of in a place and you feel that things aren't going ([Time 0:37:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e2ff49e8cddee92c2e5f39)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: in the future. \nSpeaker 1: And I guess most people's dream job would be one where they've got pleasure plus purpose in the same thing and that would be great.

But also look at those kind of small moments, you know, if you have an interaction today with somebody and they insult you, it would probably weigh really heavy on you, whereas if somebody gives you a huge compliment, how long do you hold on to that? Which is a really interesting thing for us as humans right? That we were focused on the negative we're ([Time 0:38:21](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e2ff61e8cddee92c2e635a)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: and they try to move forward in a way, so try to find a side or try to find another entrance and then these people with an external locus of control who believe that everything happens to them. So it's at the hands of other people, um it's at the hands of the universe in the extreme, most of us will have both. Internal, external looks control depending on our domain. So maybe in family life, some people will have internal locus of control. They believe that they can control everything, they feel quite safe in their family life, in the work life, they think their career is happening to them. And I think again, it isn't all or nothing. So getting people to think about what is it that I can actually control in this particular moment and taking the choice to take that control. So, I think even for people who are having a really terrible time in toxic ([Time 0:41:07](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e30005e8cddee92c2e7ab0)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: seeing the bad things that are happening to them with the idea that they can get out of that situation. \nSpeaker 1: Mm How do people end up with internal slash external local? Okay, \nSpeaker 0: we don't know. So this this will come down in the same way like genetics. So, you would have people who believe in nature and people who believe in nurture and I think the reality is that it's probably a combination of both. So our genetics probably give us some proportion of our locus of control when we're born, depending on the kind of experiences that our ancestors have had. But I think the biggest thing is going to be the environment that you actually grew up in. So I think if you put in an environment where you're encouraged to make decisions when you're really young, you're encouraged to kind of choose your own path, choose your own toys in the play box, for example, that's going to allow you think ([Time 0:42:03](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e3003de8cddee92c2e829d)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: in that particular situation? What could I have done differently? What was my input and what was down to luck? And in luck, I would put anything that's determined outside yourself by other by other people. And then it's really about identifying those things that you can control and taking hold of them and not over obsessing on the stuff that is outside you're outside your control. So in some ways it's kind of taking the best of the internal locus of control, recognizing that luck does play a role in determining these outcomes of success and failure. And people who do these postmortems really juicy learning and failure, but they don't dwell on failure. Um so if they have a face, if they fail on a particular moment, they're sitting down saying what could I have done differently and then for the future they're taking those lessons on board. Yeah.

Speaking \nSpeaker 1: of failure. So you're talking that chapter about anticipating failure and how often that hold hold people back. I wonder if you can talk like, what does that mean to anticipate failure? \nSpeaker 0: Yes. I mean, the anticipation of an event brings on anxieties that can be worse than actually experiencing an event itself. So very often if you talk to people who report having anxieties or who report having worries, They're talking about something that might actually happen in the future one than something that they're going through in a particular ([Time 0:45:06](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e31555e8cddee92c3170a8)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: on this? \nSpeaker 0: Well, that's a great one. So lowering the cost of actually doing things, you could liken it when you're, you're somebody who doesn't like running, putting your running shoes and your gear out in the, in the nights that you actually slip them on. What you describe, the really reminds me of the Pomodoro technique that has been shown to work really well from across the nature is so the idea that you don't plan to work for the day, you just show up for 20 minutes. Um and there's something about our brain not wanting to have something that hasn't closed the loop that will keep us working. The Pomodoro technique says you work for 20 minutes and regardless of if you're in flow, you take a five minute break and when you take that five minute break, you will start worrying and giggling and really wanting to actually go back to the task. So the sheer act of showing up for those 1st 20 minutes will get you on the path that you \nSpeaker 1: described.

Each hour or week or year is like a container being carried on the belt, which we must fill as it passes, if we’re to feel that we’re making good use of our time. When there are too many activities to fit comfortably into the containers, we feel unpleasantly busy; when there are too few, we feel bored. If we keep pace with the passing containers, we congratulate ourselves for “staying on top of things” and feel like we’re justifying our existence; if we let too many pass by unfilled, we feel we’ve wasted them. If we use containers labeled “work time” for the purposes of leisure, our employer may grow irritated.

Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time—instead of just being time, you might say—it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally “out of the way.” ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B08FGV64B1\u0026location=282))\n\n---\n\nThe universal truth behind my specific issues is that most of us invest a lot of energy, one way or another, in trying to avoid fully experiencing the reality in which we find ourselves. We don’t want to feel the anxiety that might arise if we were to ask ourselves whether we’re on the right path, or what ideas about ourselves it could be time to give up. We don’t want to risk getting hurt in relationships or failing professionally; we don’t want to accept that we might never succeed in pleasing our parents or in changing certain things we don’t like about ourselves—and we certainly don’t want to get sick and die. The details differ from person to person, but the kernel is the same. We recoil from the notion that this is it—that this life, with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it unfolds, is the only one we’ll get a shot at.

And so, instead, like the dutiful and efficient worker I was, I’d put my energy into clearing the decks, cranking through the smaller stuff to get it out of the way—only to discover that doing so took the whole day, that the decks filled up again overnight anyway, and that the moment for responding to the New Delhi email or for researching the milestone article never arrived.

But if you don’t approach your to-do list in this order, you’ll never fit the bigger things in at all.

Perhaps the most appealing way to resist the truth about your finite time is to initiate a large number of projects at once; that way, you get to feel as though you’re keeping plenty of irons in the fire and making progress on all fronts. Instead, what usually ends up happening is that you make progress on no fronts—because each time a project starts to feel difficult, or frightening, or boring, you can bounce off to a different one instead. You get to preserve your sense of being in control of things, but at the cost of never finishing anything important. The alternative approach is to fix a hard upper limit on the number of things that you allow yourself to work on at any given time. In their book Personal Kanban, which explores this strategy in detail, the management experts Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry suggest no more than three items.

Now it became the intuitive thing to do: it was clear that if I nominated “write book” or “move house” as one of my three tasks in progress, it would clog up the system for months, so I was naturally motivated to figure out the next achievable step in each case instead. Rather than trying to do everything, I found it easier to accept the truth that I’d be doing only a few things on any given day. The difference, this time, was that I actually did them.

As soon as I start trying to live any of those lives, though, I’ll be forced to make trade-offs—to put less time than I’d like into one of those domains, so as to make space for another—and to accept that nothing I do will go perfectly anyway, with the result that my actual life will inevitably prove disappointing by comparison with the fantasy.

As you surface from an hour inadvertently frittered away on Facebook, you’d be forgiven for assuming that the damage, in terms of wasted time, was limited to that single misspent hour. But you’d be wrong. Because the attention economy is designed to prioritize whatever’s most compelling—instead of whatever’s most true, or most useful—it systematically distorts the picture of the world we carry in our heads at all times.

The truth is addictive.   In contrast, if you refuse to lose a debate, your brain keeps running old firmware.   (I realized this after comparing humble versus tribalist people arguing on Twitter. Personally, to be comfortable being wrong, I needed to appreciate that being occasionally wrong doesn't make me look dumb to people I admire. People judge you more on your trailing average of thoughts than on the last thing you said. And good friends don't care either way.)\n*Learn to enjoy being proven wrong*\n\n---\n\n[Coaching](../Coaching.md) is not the same thing as giving advice. Coaching is strategic advice giving. It's about helping people improve their thinking—not solving problems for them. Don't hand them your answers wrapped in a question, e.g. don't say \"Have you thought about doing...\" That's not strategic. Instead, ask questions to guide them there.  One way to start is by asking them two questions: \"How can I support you?\" → Forces them to think through how to best use your time and theirs. \"What do you ultimately want?\" → Forces them to think through which obstacle matters most. Focus on that. Do not tackle everything at once.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.114640704-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Highlights-Three-New-Books-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail":{"title":"Highlights Three New Books 🍌 - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail","content":"\nHighlights: Three New Books 🍌 - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article4.6bc1851654a0.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Create account*\n* Full Title: Highlights: Three New Books 🍌 - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n* URL: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzGpFqbtcqHMkRGgRWQVlZqGkgjx\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nBloggers who post frequently (say, twice weekly) are rarely worth reading consistently.   I read for insights.

And this is not to say old, timey things are bad. I grew up going to the Coolidge Corner movie house, the Coolidge Corner, Brookline, Massachusetts, where I grew, which is my hometown. You wrote a penny-farthing to work? I did not write. I did not write a penny. I'm not that kind of lonesome. But you know, at that time, all they would do is show old Marx Brothers movies and the Thin Man marathons and even more recent old movies, as it were. And I love, I would love going into so-called nostalgia stores to pour through old movie posters, and I love used bookstores. I love the trappings of scene culture, what it was like at a time that was different from the way it is in my own life. I love to rummage through junk stores and thrift stores and fine stuff.

That was the only thing I could read before going to sleep, because I was in such emotional pain in the present.\nSpeaker 1\nHad you read those as a younger lad?\nSpeaker 3\nWell, no, because I mean, no, but because they didn't exist. But those decay books of the Star Wars vehicles that sort of give you these cross sections of all the vehicles, it was not engaging with new culture per se. I was just revisiting my feelings about Star Wars. Do you know what I mean? I understood. Yeah. So I was exactly playing with old toys playing with my old AT-AT. I never had the AT-AT, nor did I have the Millennium Falcon.\nSpeaker 1\nI never had either one of those two, and I'm still a little bitter about it still.\nSpeaker 3\nYeah, I know. Those were the big ticket items, but for sure. For my point of view, storage was a real problem with those things. Very untidy.\nSpeaker 1\nWell, they served as storage boxes themselves, really.\nSpeaker 3\nYeah, but you couldn't put the AT-AT into the Millennium Falcon, and none of them fit into any good-sized shelf.

It was my favorite in bed as a grown man next to my wife to fall asleep. I would certainly read about the propulsion mechanism of a best-pin twin cloud car. I gotcha. For sure. And dig into those weeds and prod those feelings. And indeed, today, it's still the case that I have two things on my nightstand. Because night is the time when you might be most prompted to feel nostalgia. Because on the one hand, you're trying to ease yourself to rest. And on the other hand, as you grow older, in particular, you realize that every going to sleep time is a rehearsal for your own death. So whatever you're anxious about can really come out at night or in the middle of the night, right, when you wake up during second sleep, which is a concept that I heard about first on the Great Stuff You Should Know podcast available on the How Stuff Works Network, right? Okay. That plugs in. And so on my bedside table, both real and virtual, I have two sets of culture, right?

But even those are comics that I've not really read before because they were before my time. So even then, but it's like, I get it. I totally appreciate it. And was illuminated, I should say, by your podcast for pointing out that this therapeutic, personal therapeutic aspect of transporting yourself or giving yourself a good feeling by re-encountering or re-encountering culture from your past or thinking about good times from your past is real and measurable and and scientific, right? That was part of your conclusion, correct? Yeah. Right. So I get, I am on board with you for that, that nostalgia from a personal point of view can be a truly soothing therapeutic tool that can help calm you during periods of stress and and this disorder in your life. And that's like a drug though, right?

Just a few weeks later, the economy went into a tailspin. They’ve spent the past two years recalibrating their worldview and their definition of success. \n\nThis is the situation I found myself in coming out of undergrad and why I decided to stick around for my MBA program instead of trying to jump directly into the job market.\n\n---\n\nWhen people ask what I think they should do, I rarely answer their question directly. Instead, I run the question aloud through one of my models. I’ll describe how the process in the model worked its way through an industry quite different from their own. And then, more often than not, they’ll say, “OK, I get it.” And they’ll answer their own question more insightfully than I could have. \n[Explain how you approach the problem instead of trying to answer the question](../Explain%20how%20you%20approach%20the%20problem%20instead%20of%20trying%20to%20answer%20the%20question.md)\n\n---\n\nOne of the theories that gives great insight on the first question—how to be sure we find happiness in our careers—is from Frederick Herzberg, who asserts that the powerful motivator in our lives isn’t money; it’s the opportunity to learn, grow in responsibilities, contribute to others, and be recognized for achievements.\n*Goals \u0026 Principles*\n\n---\n\nI can guarantee you that not a single one of them graduated with the deliberate strategy of getting divorced and raising children who would become estranged from them. And yet a shocking number of them implemented that strategy. The reason? They didn’t keep the purpose of their lives front and center as they decided how to spend their time, talents, and energy.\n\n---\n\nI have a bunch of “businesses” that compete for these resources: I’m trying to have a rewarding relationship with my wife, raise great kids, contribute to my community, succeed in my career, contribute to my church, and so on. And I have exactly the same problem that a corporation does. I have a limited amount of time and energy and talent.\n[Invest in your life's goals](../Invest%20in%20your%20life's%20goals.md)\n\n---\n\nI’ve concluded that the metric by which God will assess my life isn’t dollars but the individual people whose lives I’ve touched. I think that’s the way it will work for us all. Don’t worry about the level of individual prominence you have achieved; worry about the individuals you have helped become better people. This is my final recommendation: Think about the metric by which your life will be judged, and make a resolution to live every day so that in the end, your life will be judged a success.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.123691473-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/How-and-Why-to-Make-Time-to-Think-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail":{"title":"How and Why to Make Time to Think - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Mike Schmitz*\n* Full Title: How and Why to Make Time to Think - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n* Category:\n* URL: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzGlkFzdBpVjTVDlFjHSvQwCLsnK\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nPut thinking time on your calendar.

And I wasn't particularly good at the dating game, let's be fair. You can't put a price on that. And so I think where you kind of have looked inside yourself and kind of looked into your own value system there, and I'm not going to give you a therapy session now about around that. But it's common what people do is they kind of base their prices based on their own value system. But what you're actually doing there is you're making a decision on behalf of everybody else in your world, all of your clients. So when you say, well, I think I'm only worth 40 pounds an hour, you're kind of making a decision on behalf of all of your clients, which might may or may not be serving them justly. So think about it this way. There are things where maybe if you haven't paid enough for it, do you really value it that much, whereas actually if you've paid a lot for something, do you cover it, cherish it, look after it, take care of it, think whether if you're a capitalistic expensive cars and things like that, like you get the slightest dingy, like, oh my God, just ding my car sort of thing. So you really cover things that you're actually investing in. So when it comes to coaching especially, it's much better to be at the more expensive end of it, because then what you get is clients who are invested in the process. They're more likely to do the things which you're encouraging them to do. And as a result of that, they're more likely to get better results. Right. So if you're charging five to 10k for this transformation process. Five to 10k. My goodness. We're coming to that. Okay. So this is part of the coaching process. So let's say you're charging five to 10k for this coaching process, you're going to get very committed clients, but also you don't need that many clients to work with each year in order to build a sustainable profitable coaching practice.

So i feel like everyone else also has the issue around it, i don't know where to position you or what books to put you in, and then it becomes a little bit uneasy for them. But i think after a while, i just stood firm with the fact that i love to do lots of things, and i always will love to do lots of things, and that's ok. And if it's ok with me, then that's, that's what matters.

She could see how she was making at difference. i doubt id be like, you haven't done any work all day.

Apparently was a thing more back in the day where it's like, oh, you know, it's just a job. I survive the nine to five so that i can enjoy the five to nine and work. Basically just being this thing that, you know, i speak to my mama about thit sometimes. And its when when we're talking about this, this thing that i do of like uchivillios and podcast iere, working on a birkin, like the portfolio type of stuff. One thing that she will sometimes say is that, you know, the the fun and games has to stop sometime. Oh, that gong o be adult someti but, you know, we're looking at crosculturaln norational differences.\nSpeaker 1\nI rememberd i'd be at home wand i was living at home at that point, and, you know, i doubt id be like, you haven't done any work all day. And i've been on my laptop, like, you know, working doing reports, f craing presentations. But in his mind, you went somewhere, you did a a solid day's job, and then you came back, you had those stories to retell. And here i was, just, like, tapping away at the dining table, on my lap door. And i think there's also for them, and maybe speaking of my parents, it wasn't easy the work place. And i think a, you know, think some things have changed and some things haven't. But, you know, there was a certain pride in like, doing good work and delivering great value.

I was, i was having a bunch of sort of casual conversations with people in our team, basically asking, you know, like, if you didn't have to work, what would you doing with your time? And like, one of our team members mentioned that, you know, she's like singing. She's like sitting or there, actually, and just has incredible singing voice. Like, started making videos an, like, you tuben in aram, a little bit of streaming around singing. And her whole thing was that, like, ye id, i'd really want to explore the singing thingso my next questions like, oh, what' stopping you?\nSpeaker 3\nAnd then therewas some kind of barrier of like, ah, but like, i feel like i don't have the time with the day job. And i was like, well, we could easily put you down to he we as we not time.\nSpeaker 2\nLike, what would be stopping you thenand i it was almost like there was this emotional block or some sort of hurdle that's like sor of that that step beyond the threshold of like, am i she oing to folow that dream? And i imagie thire is somthing you lot likee how? Howsh how should people navigate that kind of potential leap?\nSpeaker 1\nYes, we all have different blocks for lots of different reasons. Wryt, so for whatever notion, there is a talk about this in psychotherapy, that we all have a life script. And it is generally a script that was embedded in you from about seven or so, and then you are then perpetually living it, or trying to run away from it. And a lot of our actions, sometimes, depending on our personality traits, our historical upbringing, these can deter you from taking decisions. ([Time 0:08:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/93ba94ee-4259-49d4-b757-6581f7faa7df))\n\n## [Life Script](../Life%20Script.md)\n\nDoes Your Work Need to Be That Purpose For You?\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nI wanted, i think i was really craving to see the direct impact and to work more closely with one t one people. I think there's something about noticing the company that you work for, and whether or not you can see what you're creating is being, you know, supporting the wider goal or the wider community. Also asking yourself, the question i had this with a client recently, is like, does your work need to be that purpose for you? Like, when you find it outside of work, is that something actually, if this work actually just really fuels the life that you set up for yourself and what you need to do, but actually you're really interested in, you know, coaching young start ups around ip law, like, could that not be something that you do on the week ends in the evening? You have, you know, your men tooring. So i think sometimes we have to be mindful to to try to force everything into this job. And much like your partner, there can't be everything. You will have friends who will provide different things you'll have, you know, and maybe the cor qualities that you look for in your partner is what sustains you and everything else holds you into place. And so in a way, provided that work has the cor qualities that your looking for, it doesn't necessarily need to take all f the boxes. It might not lead to for some people, it might be actes and non negotiable, and then they're in the wrong business. So then the management consultancy might not be for them, and they need to make peace with i need to do a clean sweep and move elsewhere.

It's, it sounds like a big part of this is genuinely just sitting down and figuring out, like, han are my proerties? What are the things i actually care about? And then figuring out, like, we' gont we don't ave the time to dos it's, it's such an unusual thing to do, to actuly ly, sit down anhour and think, what do i hiher about? Ye.\nSpeaker 1\nI mean, it's like, because before you know it, like another, i mean, were half over, half way through the air, right? And we've already had two years in a pandemic, and you know, we're starting another year soon, and it's just time, we'll fly. And you're in great health, you have ople around you. So, like, why don't you actually take some times ame consider, time to just ask that question, and keep asking that question, why do i want to do this? Why am i curious about this? And why do i keep telling myself i can't do it? And just think, you know, where do i want to be a year from nowwaswat listened to his great podcast a couple days ago, and it was just like, you know, people forget that it is that consistency that you just put in for a couple of months, six months, that then really changes the trajectory of the next couple of years. But we don't want to be consistent. It's not fun to be consistent. We get distracted. And, you know, we are manipulated to be distracted. We are manipulated to consume, to like, push ourselves to distract ourselves with music and entertainment and off your life course. And it is taking that time to be silent and still, which is difficult.

Sa, isan, interesting break down. I guess part of it is o ka, so i tend to be quite like a fast mover with things. It's like, if i have an idea, right, call, hit sut, do the thing. And but then traditional business advice is that, yes, that works when you'rea team of one or two people. You have a team of lead that's bigger, you then necessarily have to slow downand you have to spend time getting people up to speed and like building the systems and the processes and all the stuff. And there's something about that that feels super frustrating. Tat's like a just want to move faster. An, i just want us to have that kind of scrappy start up mentality that we had, like two years ago, the you're not a star upany yes, exactly. So that's one area in which there's this sort of me wanting to go in a particular direction, particular speed, but like, very reasonably, people point out that actually, maybe you got toslow down. And so that's one of those areas in which i find there's thie's constant tension between the way i want to do things and the way i would do things by default.\nSpeaker 1\nVhers is the way you arequit supposed to do things once you no longer start up once you are en many people. And i wonder if part of that is you needing to exercise your creativity, maybe elsewhere beyond this, or in something where you feel like you can try and break something, but not necessarily do it in the bu perhaps there is an energy that needs to be out souced elsewhere.

And you start to do it, and then you realize, actually, i don't want to interview people. I kind of want to do solo things like but you don't know win til you try. And i think every time i i invite my clients to think, i cay, let's experiment with this. Let's play and see at different opposite ends of the spectrum. You know, one lady shslike, got my gore. So i found some people unlinked in ti. I've got er coffees with to interview them. And then i had a chat with one person, and she's like, actually, 80 % of the job is this. And she's like, i just don't want to do that. And i really thought that the way this job was sold, actually, if i'm spending 80 % of my time doing that, i don't think i want ye. So i don't want to move in that direction. So i think there's just that process of trial and error, peeling away, like, how do i show up doing this thing? And do i need to be under the weight of this thing has to carry me for the next five, ten, 20 years, untel, i'm 60. No, it could actually be that you're a serial specialist and you spend five years doing that thing, and then you put it to bed, and it's five years doing something else.

When you are in a conversation, listening to a lecture, hear something noteworthy or an idea pops into your mind while you are running errands, a quick note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of doing. That might even apply to reading, if you want to focus on a text without interrupting your reading flow. Then you might want to just underline sentences or write short comments in the margins.

But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information.

In a small but fascinating study, two psychologists tried to find out if it made a difference if students in a lecture took notes by hand or by typing them into their laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). They were not able to find any difference in terms of the number of facts the students were able to remember.

([Location 2130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2130))\n\n---\n\nHe advocates looking out for the most powerful concepts in every discipline and to try to understand them so thoroughly that they become part of our thinking. ([Location 2164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2164))\n- Note: This is why I like knowing a little bit about many things, as it lays a good foundation for decision making.\n\n---\n\nA truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes. This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience. ([Location 2174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2174))\n\n---\n\nBut we can make it a habit to always ask what is not in the picture, but could be relevant. ([Location 2310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2310))\n- Note: This is not natural, but can set us apart in our thinking.\n\n---\n\nOften, companies don’t even keep track of their own failed attempts, providing McMath with whole series in which one kind of mistake was made in multiple variations, sometimes from each generation of developers in the same company ([Location 2322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2322))\n- Note: If we only focus on our successes we will fall into the same traps in the future.\n\n---\n\nIt is very good to know what has already proven to not work if we try to come up with new ideas that do work. ([Location 2330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2330))\n- Note: Reading books only from people who found success only gives one half of the story. Perhaps the lucky half\n\n---\n\nEach note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling. ([Location 2374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2374))\n\n---\n\nLanguage in itself is extremely standardised and limited in many ways. We are restricted to the use of only 26 letters, but what that enables us to do! We can write novels, theories, love letters or court orders – just by rearranging these 26 letters. This is certainly not possible despite the restriction to 26 letters, but because of it. Nobody will open a book and wish it contains more types of letters or be disappointed because it is, again, just another variation of the same alphabet. ([Location 2393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2393))\n- Note: But this is also why language evolves because we have a limited set of letters and words. Would this repurposing of words still happen with more letters available to us?\n\n---\n\nJust look into your slip-box and see where clusters have been built up. These clusters are what caught your interest again and again, so you already know that you have found material to work with. Now you can spread out these notes on your desktop or use the outliner of the Zettelkasten, outline your argument and construct a preliminary order of sections, chapters or paragraphs. This will make questions, which are not answered, obvious, and it will show the gaps in the argument that need to be filled and make visible which parts still need some work. ([Location 2418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2418))\n\n---\n\nBeing intimately familiar with something enables us to be playful with it, to modify it, to spot new and different ideas without running the risk of merely repeating old ideas believing they are new. ([Location 2490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2490))\n- Note: Early into a specific field we feel we are doing innovative things that are not novel or new. As we spend more time with a field we feel like we are being less innovative, but are actually being more innovative. [We are poor judges of how innovative our ideas are](../seedlings/We%20are%20poor%20judges%20of%20how%20innovative%20our%20ideas%20are.md). This is another form of the [Curse of Knowledge](../Curse%20of%20Knowledge.md).\n\n---\n\nNothing motivates us more than seeing a project we can identify with moving forward, and nothing is more demotivating than being stuck with a project that doesn’t seem to be worth doing. ([Location 2508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2508))\n\n---\n\n“When people experienced a sense of autonomy with regard to the choice, their energy for subsequent tasks was not diminished. ([Location 2529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2529))\n- Note: This leads me to think we should give engineering a budget and let them decide what they should spend it on. We should stay out of the decision making process and support what they decide.\n\n---\n\nWith this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 125–55) It is like martial arts: If you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it, but redirect it towards another productive goal. ([Location 2572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2572))\n\n---\n\nIf there is one piece of advice that is worth giving, it is to keep in mind that the first draft is only the first draft. Slavoj Žižek said in an interview\\[41\\] that he wouldn’t be able to write a single sentence if he didn’t start by convincing himself he was only writing down some ideas for himself, and that maybe he could turn it into something publishable later. By the time he stopped writing, he was always surprised to find that the only thing left to do was revise the draft he already had. ([Location 2643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2643))\n- Note: Just get started. Its easier to revise later than than to try to get it perfect from the start\n\n---\n\nCivilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” ([Location 2659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2659))\n- Note: This is the argument for laying the foundation to build upon. Also why recurring meetings should have agendas.\n\n---\n\nThe goal here is to get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects. If we manage to establish a routine in this first step, it becomes much easier to develop the urge to turn these findings into permanent notes and connect them with other notes in the slip-box.

([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=386))\n- Note: We did a good job at employing this at the Valley go live.\n\n---\n\nMore often than not, people who vent or complain already know how to handle their current situation—they’re just looking for someone to see and appreciate their struggle. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=388))\n\n---\n\nThere are, of course, countless ways to validate. As long as you show the other person that you recognize and accept their emotions, you’re validating. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=393))\n\n---\n\nThe truth is there’s nothing inherently good or bad about any emotion. Emotions just are. They’re simply reactions to a situation. And, whether we like it or not, we’re going to feel a whole slew of them, each and every day, for the rest of our lives. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=420))\n\n---\n\nWhen someone is in that state, a simple “don’t worry” doesn’t help. If you instead show them that you see and appreciate what they’re feeling, they’ll either find a solution of their own, or become much more willing to listen to yours. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=447))\n\n---\n\nThe result is simple, respectful, nonjudgmental support that helps Amy talk through and let go of her frustration rather than trying to ignore or suppress it. Their conversation becomes much more pleasant and connecting, and leads to a significantly more positive outcome. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=552))\n\n---\n\nValidation has two main elements. It 1) acknowledges a specific emotion, and 2) offers justification for feeling that emotion. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=662))\n\n---\n\nValidation is nonjudgmental. It allows the other person to feel whatever they’re feeling without labeling it as “good” or “bad.” ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=665))\n\n---\n\nOffering validation—before or instead of offering advice or assurance—is often the best way to help. Doing so helps others let go of difficult emotions much more quickly, often allowing them to find a solution to the problem on their own. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=670))\n\n---\n\nIf someone is distraught, angry, or concerned, validating them is your best chance at getting them to be receptive to feedback. The great thing is, you can validate someone even if you disagree with them. Learning to do so will give you a valuable tool for navigating confrontations, negotiations, disagreements, and the like. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=777))\n\n---\n\nEffective validation requires empathy and emotional understanding, and therefore extends beyond simple reflective listening. We need to do more than just show others we hear the words they are speaking; we need to show them we’re connecting with the emotions they’re feeling.

A text message start is an email, and what I'll do is I'll recycle the idea and each stage whenever I reuse it, I begin to see the idea in a new light.

In these 90% are things you pick up in conversations, only to forget by the next minute.

That’s it.” ([Location 35](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07GNWXTKV\u0026location=35))\n\n---\n\nThe truly prolific artists I know always have that question answered, because they have figured out a daily practice—a repeatable way of working that insulates them from success, failure, and the chaos of the outside world. They have all identified what they want to spend their time on, and they work at it every day, no matter what. Whether their latest thing is universally rejected, ignored, or acclaimed, they know they’ll still get up tomorrow and do their work. ([Location 60](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07GNWXTKV\u0026location=60))\n\n---\n\n“Relying on craft and routine is a lot less sexy than being an artistic genius. But it is an excellent strategy for not going insane.” ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07GNWXTKV\u0026location=76))\n\n---\n\nTo establish your own routine, you have to spend some time observing your days and your moods. Where are the free spaces in your schedule? What could you cut out of your day to make time? Are you an early riser or a night owl? (I’ve met very few people who love working in the afternoon. “I detest this mongrel time, neither day nor night,” wrote Charles Dickens.) Are there silly rituals or superstitions that get you in a creative mood? (I’m writing these words with a pencil, painted to look like a cigarette, dangling from my lips.) ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07GNWXTKV\u0026location=94))\n\n---\n\nA little imprisonment—if it’s of your own making—can set you free. Rather than restricting your freedom, a routine gives you freedom by protecting you from the ups and downs of life and helping you take advantage of your limited time, energy, and talent. A routine establishes good habits that can lead to your best work. ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07GNWXTKV\u0026location=104))\n\n---\n\nBest of all, I think, is that when your days pretty much have the same shape, the days that don’t have that shape become even more interesting. There’s nothing like a good prison break, and playing hooky isn’t as fun if you never go to school. What your daily routine consists of is not that important. What’s important is that the routine exists. Cobble together your own routine, stick to it most days, break from it once in a while for fun, and modify it as necessary.

Writer Steven Johnson does this in a single document he calls a “spark file”—every time he has an idea, he adds it to the file, and then he revisits the list every couple of months.

You have done what you could; some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin it well and serenely, and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense.” ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07GNWXTKV\u0026location=147))\n\n---\n\nWhen the sun goes down and you look back on the day, go easy on yourself. A little self-forgiveness goes a long way. Before you go to bed, make a list of anything you did accomplish, and write down a list of what you want to get done tomorrow. Then forget about it. Hit the pillow with a clear mind. Let your subconscious work on stuff while you’re sleeping.

This is a place where you can simply experience and bring forth what you are and what you might be. This is the place of creative incubation. At first you may find that nothing happens there. But if you have a sacred place and use it, something eventually will happen.

I live the dream, in a sense, because I get paid to do what I would probably do anyway for free. But things can get very, very tricky when you turn the thing you love into the thing that keeps you and your family clothed and fed. Everyone who’s turned their passion into their breadwinning knows this is dangerous territory. One of the easiest ways to hate something you love is to turn it into your job: taking the thing that keeps you alive spiritually and turning it into the thing that keeps you alive literally.

Note that it says “when in doubt,” not “always.” Tidying up is for when I’m stalled out or stuck. Tidying up a studio is—sorry, Ms. Kondo—not life-changing or magical. It’s just a form of productive procrastination. (Avoiding work by doing other work.) The best thing about tidying is that it busies my hands and loosens up my mind so that I either a) get unstuck or solve a new problem in my head, or b) come across something in the mess that leads to new work.

It's that you lose your progress, right? If you're working on a memo to your company and you only get 50% finished and you move to something else when you come back, you'll have lost whatever thinking was done. And this goes back to why it's so important and so powerful to save everything outside your head. When you're doing that, work externally and you step away for whatever reason, your current progress, by definition, is saved.

And like, so like, I, for example, no bunch of people who are like, you know, maybe they've got a job that they don't particularly enjoy it. Like it's fine. And they're holding it out until the next promotion or whatever. And they know they want to maybe start a side hustler, start a business on the side. They don't really know where to start. And it's like, and they'll come to me for advice being like, where do I start? And I'm like, Oh, I mean, if you were the four I work with, and then I fast, I mean, I can recommend a few books, but I've never once thought, Oh, you should hire a coach. Because in my, even though I've had coaches for the last two years, it's not a thing that connects. Whereas if someone came into me and said, how do I get better at tennis? I was like, hire a tennis coach, obviously. That's just a no brainer. Yeah. So where does one get started? If one might want to find a coach, how does that work? Sure.\nSpeaker 1\nWell, the great thing about today's environment is that we can find a coach from multitude of different platforms. So whether it is online, whether it is for a referral, an introduction, or simply hopping onto Google. Now, as with anything before you invest in a coach, it's important to get a feel for what that person is like. And that's why you should seek out an experience. And that is why when I, when I work with younger coaches who are looking to build their business, I always say, the greatest gift you can give people before they sign up to you as a client is to give them an experience of what coaching is about. Because coaching is very hard to explain to someone who has never gone through the experience. And so when you can invite somebody to have a powerful conversation, that's when they walk out of the room and said, I need coaching. ([Time 0:08:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/00d007a4-ef87-4c42-aeda-2f7931e73813)) \n\n---\n\nThe Importance of Curiosity\nKey takeaways:\n(\\* Curiosity is a key ingredient to starting any new journey, be it entrepreneurship, coaching, or anything else., * It's important to be open to new opportunities and experiences, as they will lead to new insights and insights that can help you achieve your goals.)\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nSo I give an example. Yeah. My journey into coaching wasn't because I woke up one morning and said, you know, I want to coach and speak for the rest of my life. Okay. I was in the financial industry. Yeah. I was disillusioned. I was feeling unfulfilled. Yeah. And so my curiosity at the time was what would life be like if I worked for myself and I didn't work for other people? Okay. Now that curiosity led me to read business books to what shows about entrepreneurship that led me into my first business venture, which didn't succeed. But again, I would never have started it without that curiosity. That led me to get involved in some community projects, to be exposed to different people in different environments, which led me to my second business, which didn't work out. But in that second business led me to people that guided me to this coaching event that happened one weekend that we can became the beginning of my journey. But it was curiosity that created those stepping stones. Now, here's why it's important. Whenever we begin a new path, we don't get given the entire map up front. ([Time 0:24:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fb4b3b92-815e-4345-b787-6a30fb507f22))\n\n---\n\nHow to Achieve a Vision\nKey takeaways:\n(\\* Having a compelling vision is necessary for taking action., * It is important to focus on taking small steps in order to move closer to the vision., * It is important to stay motivated by thinking about what is in one's control and taking action on those small steps.)\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nSo you mentioned that there's this sort of magnetic field of vision. So then by vision, do you just mean what is the next step? Or like, how far out are we planning here? Sure.\nSpeaker 1\nSo there's an element of having a balance here. You have to have a vision to give you context for today. Otherwise, you can take any action because you don't know where it's going to lead or where you want to be. So the vision is something that is compelling enough for you to want to take some action. Okay. Now, when we look at the action piece, it's not about taking big steps. It's then about taking small steps. So thinking big and starting small, that's the balance that we have to get. Now, the thinking big piece is what activates our emotions. Yeah, when we think about something that we want to achieve in our lifetime, that is what creates that emotional pull. When we look at a present, it's what is the one small step that is in my control that I can take to date? That's it. Just focus on today. One small step that will contribute to that vision starting to take shape. And in tomorrow, ask yourself the same question. What is one small step that I can take today that will move me forward? So that's the balance we have to have.

How much space in your diary do you currently have and how much would you need to actually give this some proper dedication? So I would look at your week and say, okay, what can you eliminate or what can you reduce to give yourself some more oxygen and space to explore this interest of yours? Now, once we've got that in place, the next part is to actually get some focus. And I think it was Cal Newport the first talked about focus being today's IQ. He said that in the past, we would measure people's IQ by how much they knew. Nowadays, when you and I can go into Google, we can ask Amazon Alexa and get an answer within seconds. It's not about how much you know now. It's about your ability to focus.

And so the next question I would ask is how will you know that with the space you have over the next seven days, it will have been the productive week. And so it's beginning with the end in mind. So now what we're doing is we're bringing a bit of focus into the space that we've created. And then now, once we've got this put together, we now have some path that we're working towards. Because at a high level, if we want to design our life, if we want to design something that is fulfilling, it begins with designing our days. If we can't design our days, how can we expect to design a life?

It sounds like, yeah, if you want to make money and you enjoy teaching and you think you'd use the money to do something good, then it would be reasonable. I'm all for that.\nSpeaker 1\nBecause as long as it's a path that is fulfilling for you, that you are interested in, that you're curious about, that pleased your strengths, why not? But also not to be attached to the outcome of it. I went to Kyoto in Japan and there was a beautiful English statement at one of the temples. And it read, be attached to no outcome and open to everything. Now, I've tried my best to embody that principle throughout my entrepreneurial journey.

But also not to be attached to the outcome of it., * To achieve multiple outcomes, you need to focus on enjoying the process, putting healthy discipline systems in place, and detach yourself from outcomes.)\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nBecause as long as it's a path that is fulfilling for you, that you are interested in, that you're curious about, that pleased your strengths, why not? But also not to be attached to the outcome of it. I went to Kyoto in Japan and there was a beautiful English statement at one of the temples. And it read, be attached to no outcome and open to everything. Now, I've tried my best to embody that principle throughout my entrepreneurial journey. Because I think so many of us get caught up in outcomes. So we'll try something. And if it doesn't work out, we tend to stop and give up. But if we can detach ourselves from outcomes, then what it allows us to do is simply just experiment. And as the second part of the sentence says, be open to everything. Very often we're like, when I get this, when I get more time, when this happens, when I get that qualification, then I'll start. When everything is ready, but the fact is we'll never be 100% ready. And if we're always measuring our success by outcomes only, then it's not going to be a very enjoyable journey. But actually, if we can focus on who we are becoming, how we are going for our own personal metamorphosis in the journey, that to me is the greatest reward. It's not what you get, but it's who you become in the process. Okay, nice.\nSpeaker 2\nSo as I'm going through this path of learning to become a coach, because maybe the destination I have in mind is like, I'll make an extra couple of grandi a month. But it sounds like you're saying I should also figure out a way to, I guess, enjoy the process and become the sort of person I want to become through the journey. Rather than being fixated on, like, I need to make two K-month extra.\nSpeaker 1\nDefinitely, because I think if you focus on enjoying the process, if you start to put healthy discipline systems in place, what happens is that you're setting yourself up to achieve multiple outcomes, not just one outcome. But you open yourself up to achieve outcomes that you may not even see possible right now.

Curiosity is a key ingredient to starting any new journey, and it's important to be open to new opportunities and experiences.\n4. Having a compelling vision is essential for taking action, but it's equally important to focus on taking small steps every day to move closer to that vision.\n5.

A successful defense lawyer says, “If you argue ten points, even if each is a good point, when they get back to the jury room they won’t remember any.” To strip an idea down to its core, we must be masters of exclusion. We must relentlessly prioritize. Saying something short is not the mission—sound bites are not the ideal. Proverbs are the ideal. We must create ideas that are both simple and profound.

We need to violate people’s expectations. We need to be counterintuitive. A bag of popcorn is as unhealthy as a whole day’s worth of fatty foods! We can use surprise—an emotion whose function is to increase alertness and cause focus—to grab people’s attention. But surprise doesn’t last. For our idea to endure, we must generate interest and curiosity.

But in many cases this is exactly the wrong approach. In the sole U.S. presidential debate in 1980 between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, Reagan could have cited innumerable statistics demonstrating the sluggishness of the economy. Instead, he asked a simple question that allowed voters to test for themselves: “Before you vote, ask yourself if you are better off today than you were four years ago.” ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B000N2HCKQ\u0026location=266))\n\n---\n\nHow do we get people to act on our ideas? We tell stories. Firefighters naturally swap stories after every fire, and by doing so they multiply their experience; after years of hearing stories, they have a richer, more complete mental catalog of critical situations they might confront during a fire and the appropriate responses to those situations. Research shows that mentally rehearsing a situation helps us perform better when we encounter that situation in the physical environment.

Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has “cursed” us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can’t readily re-create our listeners’ state of mind.

The planning process forces people to think through the right issues. But as for the plans themselves, Kolditz says, “They just don’t work on the battlefield.” So, in the 1980s the Army adapted its planning process, inventing a concept called Commander’s Intent (CI). CI is a crisp, plain-talk statement that appears at the top of every order, specifying the plan’s goal, the desired end-state of an operation.

Not simple in terms of “dumbing down” or “sound bites.” You don’t have to speak in monosyllables to be simple. What we mean by “simple” is finding the core of the idea. “Finding the core” means stripping an idea down to its most critical essence. To get to the core, we’ve got to weed out superfluous and tangential elements. But that’s the easy part. The hard part is weeding out ideas that may be really important but just aren’t the most important idea.

So, to make a profound idea compact you’ve got to pack a lot of meaning into a little bit of messaging. And how do you do that? You use flags. You tap the existing memory terrain of your audience.

Humans adapt incredibly quickly to consistent patterns. Consistent sensory stimulation makes us tune out: Think of the hum of an air conditioner, or traffic noise, or the smell of a candle, or the sight of a bookshelf. We may become consciously aware of these things only when something changes: The air conditioner shuts off. Your spouse rearranges the books.

In that context, the proverb seems intuitive. It was only when Kelleher put teeth in the proverb—refusing to offer chicken salad to customers even if they really wanted it—that its meaning sank in. Before Kelleher, an average staffer’s guessing machine might have predicted, “We want to please our customers in a low-cost way.” After Kelleher, the guessing machine was refined to “We will be THE low-cost airline, even if it means intentionally disregarding some of our customers’ preferences.” ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B000N2HCKQ\u0026location=1092))\n- Note: What seemingly reasonable thing are you willing to give up in your unabashed pursuit of your primary objective?\n\n---\n\nSo, a good process for making your ideas stickier is: (1) Identify the central message you need to communicate—find the core; (2) Figure out what is counterintuitive about the message—i.e., What are the unexpected implications of your core message? Why isn’t it already happening naturally? (3) Communicate your message in a way that breaks your audience’s guessing machines along the critical, counterintuitive dimension. Then, once their guessing machines have failed, help them refine their machines.

When messages sound like common sense, they float gently in one ear and out the other. And why shouldn’t they? If I already intuitively “get” what you’re trying to tell me, why should I obsess about remembering it? The danger, of course, is that what sounds like common sense often isn’t, as with the Hoover Adams and Southwest examples. It’s your job, as a communicator, to expose the parts of your message that are uncommon sense.

Loewenstein argues that gaps cause pain. When we want to know something but don’t, it’s like having an itch that we need to scratch. To take away the pain, we need to fill the knowledge gap. We sit patiently through bad movies, even though they may be painful to watch, because it’s too painful not to know how they end.

Abstraction is the luxury of the expert. If you’ve got to teach an idea to a room full of people, and you aren’t certain what they know, concreteness is the only safe language.

He notes that these tales are characterized by lots of concrete actions, with few abstractions. Why? The ancient Greeks certainly had no problem with abstraction—this was the society that produced Plato and Aristotle, after all. Havelock believes that the stories evolved away from abstraction over time. When they were passed along from generation to generation, the more memorable concrete details survived and the abstractions evaporated.

If you look at the two sides of Velcro material, you’ll see that one is covered with thousands of tiny hooks and the other is covered with thousands of tiny loops. When you press the two sides together, a huge number of hooks get snagged inside the loops, and that’s what causes Velcro to seal. Your brain hosts a truly staggering number of loops. The more hooks an idea has, the better it will cling to memory. Your childhood home has a gazillion hooks in your brain. A new credit card number has one, if it’s lucky.

The reason is simple: because the difference between an expert and a novice is the ability to think abstractly. New jurors are struck by lawyers’ personalities and factual details and courtroom rituals. Meanwhile, judges weigh the current case against the abstract lessons of past cases and legal precedent.

(The 4-22 runway was chosen for its length—less than a mile, which was much too short for any of the existing passenger jets.) With a goal this concrete, Boeing effectively coordinated the actions of thousands of experts in various aspects of engineering or manufacturing.

Pretty sobering stuff. It’s also pretty abstract. You probably walk away from these stats thinking something like “There’s a lot of dissatisfaction and confusion in most companies.” Then Covey superimposes a very human metaphor over the statistics. He says, “If, say, a soccer team had these same scores, only 4 of the 11 players on the field would know which goal is theirs. Only 2 of the 11 would care. Only 2 of the 11 would know what position they play and know exactly what they are supposed to do. And all but 2 players would, in some way, be competing against their own team members rather than the opponent.” The soccer analogy generates a human context for the statistics. It creates a sense of drama and a sense of movement. We can’t help but imagine the actions of the two players trying to score a goal, being opposed at every stage by the rest of their team. Why does the analogy work? It relies on our schema of soccer teams and the fact that this schema is somehow cleaner, more well-defined, than our schemas of organizations. It’s more vivid to think of a lack of cooperation on a soccer team—where teamwork is paramount—than in a corporation. And this is exactly Covey’s point: Corporations should operate like teams, but they don’t. Humanizing the statistics gives the argument greater wallop.

Use them to make up your mind on an issue. Don’t make up your mind and then go looking for the numbers to support yourself—that’s asking for temptation and trouble.

We get them to take off their Analytical Hats. We create empathy for specific individuals. We show how our ideas are associated with things that people already care about. We appeal to their self-interest, but we also appeal to their identities—not only to the people they are right now but also to the people they would like to be ([Location 3120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B000N2HCKQ\u0026location=3120))\n\n---\n\nWhy do people talk shop? Part of the reason is simply Humanity 101—we want to talk to other people about the things that we have in common.

Simulating past events is much more helpful than simulating future outcomes. In fact, the gap between the groups opened up immediately after the first session in the lab. By the first night, the event-simulation people were already experiencing a positive mood boost compared with the other two groups. When the groups returned a week later, the event simulators’ advantage had grown wider. They were more likely to have taken specific action to solve their problems. They were more likely to have sought advice and support from others. They were more likely to report that they had learned something and grown. ([Location 3248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B000N2HCKQ\u0026location=3248))\n\n---\n\nWhy does mental simulation work? It works because we can’t imagine events or sequences without evoking the same modules of the brain that are evoked in real physical activity. Brain scans show that when people imagine a flashing light, they activate the visual area of the brain; when they imagine someone tapping on their skin, they activate tactile areas of the brain. The activity of mental simulation is not limited to the insides of our heads. People who imagine words that start with b or p can’t resist subtle lip movements, and people who imagine looking at the Eiffel Tower can’t resist moving their eyes upward. Mental simulation can even alter visceral physical responses: When people drink water but imagine that it’s lemon juice, they salivate more. Even more surprisingly, when people drink lemon juice but imagine that it’s water, they salivate less. ([Location 3258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B000N2HCKQ\u0026location=3258))\n\n---\n\nMental simulation helped people weld better and throw darts better. Trombonists improved their playing, and competitive figure skaters improved their skating. Not surprisingly, mental practice is more effective when a task involves more mental activity (e.g., trombone playing) as opposed to physical activity (e.g., balancing), but the magnitude of gains from mental practice is large on average: Overall, mental practice alone produced about two thirds of the benefits of actual physical practice. The takeaway is simple: Mental simulation is not as good as actually doing something, but it’s the next best thing. And, to circle back to the world of sticky ideas, what we’re suggesting is that the right kind of story is, effectively, a simulation. Stories are like flight simulators for the brain. Hearing the nurse’s heart-monitor story isn’t like being there, but it’s the next best thing.

When the Jared article hits our desk, we want to spot the crucial elements immediately. Guy faces huge obstacles and overcomes them—it’s a Challenge plot. Challenge plots inspire people to take on challenges and work harder.

Springboard stories tell people about possibilities. One major advantage of springboard stories is that they combat skepticism and create buy-in. Denning says that the idea of telling stories initially violated his intuition. He had always believed in the value of being direct, and he worried that stories were too ambiguous, too peripheral, too anecdotal. He thought, “Why not spell out the message directly? Why go to the trouble and difficulty of trying to elicit the listener’s thinking indirectly, when it would be so much simpler if I come straight out in an abstract directive? Why not hit the listeners between the eyes?” The problem is that when you hit listeners between the eyes they respond by fighting back. The way you deliver a message to them is a cue to how they should react. If you make an argument, you’re implicitly asking them to evaluate your argument—judge it, debate it, criticize it—and then argue back, at least in their minds.

In fact, they naturally embody most of the SUCCESs framework. Stories are almost always Concrete. Most of them have Emotional and Unexpected elements.

In Chapter 1 (“Simple”), we discussed the importance of focusing on core messages—honing in on the most important truths that we need to communicate. If the world takes our ideas and changes them—or accepts some and discards others—all we need to decide is whether the mutated versions are still core. If they are—as with “It’s the economy, stupid”—then we should humbly embrace the audience’s judgment. Ultimately, the test of our success as idea creators isn’t whether people mimic our exact words, it’s whether we achieve our goals.

You \nSpeaker 0: know, what's crazy, what second brain did for me transcends all of this. What it did was it made me treat my future self as if that person was real and it didn't just have an impact with my ideas. It had an impact on the way I eat the quality of my sleep, my fitness routines. Because for the first time in my life, I was actually creating something for future David. And I was thinking, what will 30 year old David, what will 40 year old, 50, 60, 70 year old David want? And normally it's called the End of history illusion. You think that the person that you are now is the person that you're always going to be. But when you have the second brain, you're always thinking about what your future self is gonna want and it becomes this radical shift in your own identity, treating who you're going to be in the future as somebody worth considering, like a wife, like a sister, \nSpeaker 1: like a mother. \nSpeaker 0: And when that happens, you're able to act with more direction, more diligence and live a healthier ([Time 0:03:18](https://www.airr.io/quote/613cf7edf83bbd000e9e3c7d))\n([Time 0:02:36](https://www.airr.io/quote/613cf7ede4da52000f2c76cb))\n\n## *Invest in your Future Self*\n\nSpeaker 0: more direction, more diligence and live a healthier life, \nSpeaker 1: I think so. And here's the trick though, that makes doing this with ideas so powerful usually. I mean, what we're talking about here is *delayed gratification*. Usually it's a trade off. I can favor myself now or I can favor myself in the future with finances. You think I can spend the money now, I can spend the money later, that you can't really spend it both times, but with ideas you can. So what I notice is when I write something down, I get a benefit in that instant, I get the benefit of seeing my idea in a concrete form.

Each sprint day, we drew attention to one big focal point: On Monday, the team creates a map of the problem; on Tuesday, each person sketches one solution; on Wednesday, they decide which solutions are best; on Thursday, they build a prototype; and on Friday, they test it. Each day’s goal is ambitious, but it’s just one thing. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=447))\n\n---\n\nWe also learned about the importance of energy for focused work and clear thinking. When we first started running design sprints, teams worked long hours, fueled by sugary treats. Late in the week, energy would plummet. So we made adjustments, and saw how things like a healthy lunch, a quick walk, frequent breaks, and a slightly shorter workday helped maintain peak energy, resulting in better and more effective work. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=455))\n\n---\n\nThe first step is choosing a single highlight to prioritize in your day. Next, you’ll employ specific tactics to stay laser-focused on that highlight—we’ll offer a menu of tricks to beat distraction in an always-connected world. Throughout the day, you’ll build energy so you can stay in control of your time and attention. Finally, you’ll reflect on the day with a few simple notes. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=500))\n\n---\n\nThe first step in Make Time is deciding what you want to make time for. Every day, you’ll choose a single activity to prioritize and protect in your calendar. It might be an important goal at work, like finishing a presentation. You might choose something at home, like cooking dinner or planting your garden. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=506))\n\n---\n\nAsking yourself “What’s going to be the highlight of my day?” ensures that you spend time on the things that matter to you and don’t lose the entire day reacting to other people’s priorities. When you choose a Highlight, you put yourself in a positive, proactive frame of mind. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=513))\n\n---\n\nFinally, before going to bed, you’ll take a few notes. It’s super simple: You’ll decide which tactics you want to continue and which ones you want to refine or drop.2 And you’ll think back on your energy level, whether you made time for your Highlight, and what brought you joy in the day. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=536))\n\n---\n\nI loved thinking about big, lofty goals and I was good at getting things done hour by hour, but neither was truly satisfying. I was happiest when I had something I could hold on to in the present—a chunk of time that was bigger than a to-do but smaller than a five-year goal. An activity I could plan for, look forward to, and appreciate when it was done. In other words, I needed to make sure every day had a highlight. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=645))\n\n---\n\nYour Highlight gives each day a focal point. Research shows that the way you experience your days is not determined primarily by what happens to you. In fact, you create your own reality by choosing what you pay attention to.1 This might seem obvious, but we think it’s a big deal: You can design your time by choosing where you direct your attention. And your daily Highlight is the target of that attention. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=664))\n\n---\n\nThe second Highlight strategy is to think about satisfaction: At the end of the day, which Highlight will bring me the most satisfaction? ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=691))\n\n---\n\nThe third strategy focuses on joy: When I reflect on today, what will bring me the most joy? ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=704))\n\n---\n\nTo other people, some of your joyful Highlights may look like wastes of time: sitting at home reading a book, meeting a friend to play Frisbee in the park, even doing a crossword puzzle. Not to us. You only waste time if you’re not intentional about how you spend it. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=707))\n\n---\n\nA good rule of thumb is to choose a Highlight that takes sixty to ninety minutes. If you spend less than sixty minutes, you might not have time to get in the zone, but after ninety minutes of focused attention, most people need a break. Sixty to ninety minutes is a sweet spot. It’s enough time to do something meaningful, and it’s a reasonable amount of time to create in your schedule. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=717))\n\n---\n\nIf yesterday’s Highlight brought you joy or satisfaction, hey, there’s nothing wrong with more of that! Repeat to keep the good times rolling. You don’t have to reinvent yourself each day. Once you’ve identified something that’s important to you, focusing on it day after day will help it take root in your life, grow, and flourish. Sounds cheesy, but it’s true. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=776))\n\n---\n\nUse daily “do not schedule” blocks to make room for your Highlight. ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=992))\n\n---\n\nCould you squeeze in a new project but worry about giving it the proper attention? “Unfortunately, I don’t have the time to do a great job on this.” ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1045))\n\n---\n\nOur friend Kristen Brillantes uses what she calls the Sour Patch Kid method when she says no. Just like the candy, Kristen’s answers are sour at first but sweet at the end. For example: “Unfortunately, my team won’t be able to participate. But you might ask Team X; they’d be perfect for this kind of event.” The key, says Kristen, is to make sure the sweet ending is authentic, not an empty add-on. If she can, she’ll offer a connection to another person with capacity or interest for whom the invitation might be a cool opportunity. If not, she offers encouragement or gratitude. ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1054))\n\n---\n\nCoffee is also super important to me. Sure, the caffeine is nice, but the preparation routine is essential to my morning. It takes me fifteen minutes to make coffee using a simple pour-over technique: boil water, grind beans, position filter, add grounds, pour water. This process is more labor-intensive than using a machine, but that’s the idea. My slow coffee ritual keeps me occupied during the low-willpower period when I would otherwise check email or look at Twitter, both of which are likely to send me into a reactive vortex of unproductivity. Instead, I stand in the kitchen (or galley), wake up slowly, think about my day, and enjoy a fresh cup of coffee while I settle in to work on my Highlight. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1123))\n\n---\n\nFinally, adjust your environment to wind down and signal “bedtime” to your body. I begin by lowering the lights. I turn off peripheral lights in the kitchen and foyer, then switch to floor lamps in the living room and bedroom. My favorite routine—and dorkiest by far—is a do-it-yourself turn-down service. Around 7 p.m. each night, I close the curtains in the bedroom, remove the decorative pillows from the bed, and pull back the covers. (Check out #84, “Fake the Sunset,” for more.) ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1143))\n\n---\n\nIf I’m planning to stay up and work on a project, I’ll start by refreshing my brain with a real break (#80). After my younger son goes to bed (around 8:30 p.m.), I might sit down with my wife and older son and watch part of a movie. Or I might read a few pages in a novel. Or I might clean the kitchen and put away toys in the living room. These activities take my mind out of “busy mode” and recharge my mental battery—a major difference from the frenzy of checking email, reading clickbait news articles, or watching an intense TV show designed to suck me into a black hole of binge watching.7 ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1176))\n\n---\n\nAround nine-thirty, I’ll switch into Highlight mode, usually for writing but sometimes to prepare a presentation or workshop. Even with a quick battery recharge, my focus is usually not at 100 percent, so I put a vacation timer on the Internet (#28), allowing me to concentrate on my writing with minimal willpower. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1183))\n\n---\n\nI learned the hard way that I have to spin down my brain after late-night work or I’ll seriously mess up my sleep. Dimming the lights (#84) helps, but most important is getting to bed before I turn into a pumpkin. For me, that magic hour is 11:30 p.m., and if I’m not in bed by then, I’ll tank my energy the next day. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1188))\n\n---\n\nWe evolved to be distractible because it kept us safe from danger (check the flash in your peripheral vision—it might be a stalking tiger or a falling tree!). We evolved to love mysteries and stories because they helped us learn and communicate. We evolved to love gossip and seek social status because that allowed us to form tight-knit protective tribes. And we evolved to love unpredictable rewards, whether from a blackberry bush or a smartphone notification, because the possibility of those rewards kept us hunting and gathering even when we returned home empty-handed. Our caveman brains are the fourth secret ingredient. Of course we love email, video games, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat—it’s literally in our DNA. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1345))\n\n---\n\nThese tactics are all based on the same philosophy: The best way to defeat distraction is to make it harder to react. By adding a few steps that get in the way of checking Facebook, catching up on the news, or turning on the TV, you can short-circuit the cycle that makes these products so sticky. After just a few days, you’ll have a new set of defaults: You’ll go from distracted to focused, from reactive to intentional, and from overwhelmed to in control. ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1373))\n\n---\n\nIf you change your priorities, people will notice. Your actions show others what’s important to you. When your friends, your coworkers, and your kids and family see you being intentional with your time, you’ll give them permission to question their own “always on” default and step away from their own Infinity Pools. You aren’t just making time for yourself and your own Highlight; you’re also setting a good example for the people around you. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1392))\n\n---\n\nMy phone used to call to me from my pocket the way the Ring called to Bilbo Baggins. The second I felt even the slightest twinge of boredom, my phone would appear in the palm of my hand as if by magic. Now, without Infinity Pool apps, I feel less twitchy. Those moments when I used to instinctively reach for my phone, I’m forced to pause—and it turns out those moments are not so boring after all. ([Location 1418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1418))\n\n---\n\nDelete social apps.

A young Jake stood on the blistered rock and imagined the awesome force of impact. The crater is thirty times the size of the meteor! It’s crazy to think about such a small object making such a big hole. Or maybe it’s not so crazy. After all, the same thing happens in our daily lives. Small distractions create much larger holes in our day.

They satisfy an innate tribal urge. We grow up watching local teams with our parents, families, and friends. We discuss sports with colleagues and strangers.

We were supposed to be clearing it out of the way so that we could do our work, but instead, on most days, email was the work.11 It was a vicious cycle: The faster we replied, the more replies we got back and the more we strengthened the expectation of immediate responses.

A 2014 study by the University of British Columbia found that when people checked their email just three times a day (instead of as often as they wanted), they reported remarkably lower stress. As researchers Elizabeth Dunn and Kostadin Kushlev put it, “Cutting back on email might reduce stress as much as picturing yourself swimming in the warm waters of a tropical island several times a day.” Maybe more surprising, checking less often made the participants better at email. During the week when they checked three times a day, people answered roughly the same number of messages, but they did so 20 percent faster. Checking email less often measurably made time!

Snail mail gets delivered only once a day. Most letters sit on your desk for a while before you do anything about them. And for 99 percent of communications, that works just fine. Try slowing down and seeing your email as what it really is: just a fancy, dressed-up, high-tech version of regular old mail.

You could say something like this: “I’m slow to respond because I need to prioritize some important projects, but if your message is urgent, send me a text.” ([Location 1891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1891))\n\n---\n\nAs we see it, all that TV time is a gold mine: a large pile of perfectly good hours just lying there, ready to be reclaimed.

When someone else is waiting expectantly for results, it’s a lot easier to get into Laser mode.

For example, if your Highlight is “Plan vacation,” you can explode it into bits like these: Check calendar for vacation dates. Skim guidebook and make list of possible destinations. Discuss destinations with family and choose favorite. Research airfare online. Note that each item includes a verb. Each one is specific. And each one is small and relatively easy. We learned this technique from productivity shaman David Allen, who has this to say about breaking projects into physical actions: Shifting your focus to something that your mind perceives as a doable, completable task will create a real increase in positive energy, direction, and motivation.

Paper is less intimidating, too—while most software is designed to guide you through a series of steps that will lead to a finished product, paper allows you to find your own way to a cohesive idea. And paper opens up possibilities, because whereas Word is designed for lines of text and PowerPoint is designed for graphs and bullet points, on paper, you can do anything at all.

But once the caffeine wears off, all that adenosine is still hanging around, ready to pounce. If you don’t recaffeinate, you crash. And over time, your body adjusts to more and more caffeine by producing more and more adenosine to compensate.

The problem only comes when we rely on one job for too long, and stop challenging ourselves. That’s when the risk creeps in of becoming a 40-something-year-old who hasn’t upgraded their skills since they were 25.\n\n---\n\nI’ve changed my opinion on the topic of goals in recent times. I used to think they were a bit pointless in that you’re almost signing up to a contract of unhappiness until you hit the goal. But actually having a goal doesn’t mean you’re wedded to it. And without having some kind of destination to aim for in the first place you’ll never set off on the journey. So if you feel like you’re at a crossroads, just pick something and start moving towards it. It’s much easier to change direction when you’re moving forward rather than when you’re stationary.\n\n---\n\n“Every Sunday reflect on how the week previous went and look to see if there are new opportunities that you can be pivoting your goal for” \\[57:49\\] I first came across weekly review stuff when I read Getting Things Done by David Allen about 5 years ago - but I’ve done about 4 weekly reviews since then.

In that time, they spend the first 5 minutes giving the group context about their work / personal life, and sharing their most pressing challenge, or something they’re struggling with. Then, for the next 15 minutes, the group is allowed to do two things: (1) ask questions, or (2) share a personal experience relevant to their situation. Crucially, no one in the group is allowed to “give advice”.\n\nThis is a great format, and something I’d 100% recommend you try next time you’re with a group of wholesome friends. It’s a great way of connecting with each other, and also a brilliant way to get perspectives on your work or life challenges that you might not have considered.

When the book comes out, it will most likely be in the *self improvement* section. You know, it's about being more effective at life having better results, um being less stressed and doing more with less right productivity, if ([Time 0:00:00](https://www.airr.io/quote/612ff01be042d5000f4d2881))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: constraints and deadlines and priorities and things, but just to wake up and do what we feel like, think about what we feel like pursue whatever calls to us, whatever inspires us, right? So to me that I'm already anticipating like *retirement* or just in the future and thinking, okay, if I'm going to have nothing on my mind, I need to start preparing for that, I need to start outsource instead of taking on all the responsibility to myself, doing all the kinds of thinking myself. How can I already start delegating? You know, the most basic kinds of thinking to start to machines, to computers so that over time I can have less on my mind instead of more. \nSpeaker 0: Yeah, but the ([Time 0:01:45](https://www.airr.io/quote/612ff08ae042d5000f4d30a7))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: what it's good at, which is remembering and you're focused on what you're good at, which is open ended thinking. \nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's a great point. It's another parallel to *Finance*. You know, I never wanted to think about my finances budget save because I thought, oh, that's for retirement, decades from now. But then when you go through really looking at your finances, the benefits are instantaneous. You right away once you start budgeting, let's say, start having *less stress*. You know, where your money is coming from, where it's stored, where it's going. You make better decisions, you're less impulsive, you have just a greater sense of security. So it's like you're using that the future projection to make changes that benefit you right now.

It's stuff that doesn't add that much value. And it's stuff that is very routine and repeatable, answering emails, scheduling things, you know, uh summarizing their reading, writing up reports or plans or agendas. It's like this kind of just bread and butter of knowledge work that is the perfect target for stuff like the stuff that you want to delegate to your second brain. How can you turn those repeatable low value activities into *notes*, into *checklists*, into *templates*, into *models*, into things that don't require you to reinvent them from scratch each time that you can just access the results of your past thinking.  Speaker 0: I think one of the things that's such a deep assumption is that in order to achieve more we need to work harder. We need to expel more energy. We need to grind and stuff like that. But what a second brain is is it's about one time actions that have multi time benefits. \nSpeaker 1: Exactly compounding again finance right?

But how it gets from the input to the output is a little unclear um but I do think that that ([Time 0:03:58](https://www.airr.io/quote/612ff8a5dbfd52000e023dd0))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: visited it before you click there. You have some memory of where on the page that answer is you go through all those steps so quickly that it's as if you know it, even though if I forced you to come up with it without google, you wouldn't be able to write. So I think google in a funny way has actually introduced us to this idea of like cognitive extension um more than we realize. But there's a couple things that we can't do. Okay, so a couple things first, Google doesn't have your version of that knowledge, *your interpretation*, your take because when you come across a google result you can't edit it. That's control that's owned, that's literally owned and monetized by someone else or some other company. So if you have any interpretation, even if even if that's just you want to put more emphasis on a idea instead of the idea, you can't change it. There's nothing no *highlighting*, no *reorganizing*, no [editing](Editing.md), no *annotating* none of that you can do on that web page. But there's something else too, which is there's this idea in the world of finance of *Alpha*, right? This idea that there's certain knowledge that is not universally known, that you can't just do a google search. You can't just look it up either because it's not well distributed, it's not widely known, it's not on the internet, it's only in the minds of certain people, for example, and that's the most valuable knowledge. It's not on the internet, it's only in the minds of certain people, for example, and that's the most valuable knowledge, right?

Because what I hear in that, in that comment is this idea that I have figured out the ultimate perfect way for them to be successful. They need to just perfectly copy and mimic my perfect way and I just couldn't be further from the truth.

And there's something else too. I mean, that's a that's an extreme example, but just They they really lose the plot. If you can remember what happened, you know, 30 years ago, the same as yesterday, The level of detail in your head becomes like a noise, nothing gets forgotten, nothing falls away. Everything is front and center. It's like having 50 stereos right in front of you all turned up to maximum volume, right? Um and so I think more and more in the study of the human brain, we're understanding that forgetting is actually a powerful capability and then you go to digital note taking and people are doing everything they can to never ever forget anything ever. Isn't that an interesting paradox? Right? So I'm actually curious like I want to know, taking out that has forgetting as a future if you don't access a note or at least you know, change it or edit it or modify or distillate in some way, after a certain period of time it just falls away just gets deleted.

Okay with randomness. How do you actually help me figure this out \nSpeaker 0: to s models and experiments? Okay, so the first is models.

Since then, I have rarely been without a Field Notes notebook in my back pocket. These Field Notes notebooks represent my short-term memory. They contain fleeting notes, lists, ideas, names of people.\n\n[Handwritten notes are a form of short-term memory](../Handwritten%20notes%20are%20a%20form%20of%20short-term%20memory.md)\n\n---\n\nMy process for capturing my notes in Obsidian is straight-forward. At the end of each day, I open my Daily Notes file for the day and do the following: Flip through notes in my Field Notes notebook looking for anything worth saving. Transfer those items worth saving into my daily notes. Elaborate on these as necessary. Most of what I jot in these notebooks stays in the notebooks. The most common things to go into Obsidian are: blog post ideas notes jotted about things I read or listed to notes from experiences, like tours, museum visits, etc1.\n\n---\n\n4. A notebook gets me off screens, for at least some of the day I try to avoid screens for everything. When I walk in the morning and have an idea for a post, or want to jot a note on the book I am listening to, I don’t want to look at a screen. My notebook provides a convenient way to capture fleeting thoughts without depending on my phone.\n   [Find time away from screens](../Find%20time%20away%20from%20screens.md)\n\n---\n\nIt is difficult to search the notebooks this way. I once spent quite a bit of time searching for a beer brand in my notebooks. But that’s why I lean toward keeping notes in Obsidian that I think will be useful in the future.\n*Notebooks are not easily searchable*\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.26454396-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Practically-Paperless-With-Obsidian-Episode-27-Use-Case-Journal-Writing-in-Obsidian":{"title":"Practically Paperless With Obsidian, Episode 27 Use Case Journal Writing in Obsidian","content":"\n# Practically Paperless With Obsidian, Episode 27: Use Case: Journal Writing in Obsidian\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://jamierubin.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-photo-942872.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Jamie Todd Rubin*\n* Full Title: Practically Paperless With Obsidian, Episode 27: Use Case: Journal Writing in Obsidian\n* URL: https://jamierubin.net/2022/04/19/practically-paperless-with-obsidian-episode-27-use-case-journal-writing-in-obsidian\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nTo add structure, however, I began numbering my journal entries.

Good performance on a test during the learning process can indicate mastery, but learners and teachers need to be aware that such performance will often index, instead, fast but fleeting progress.” ([Location 1407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07H1ZYWTM\u0026location=1407)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nthe most successful problem solvers spend mental energy figuring out what type of problem they are facing before matching a strategy to it, rather than jumping in with memorized procedures.

([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00ICN066A\u0026location=117))\n\n---\n\nIn Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest-time energy. ([Location 185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00ICN066A\u0026location=185))\n\n---\n\nAnd, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still under-developed. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and education. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00ICN066A\u0026location=205))\n\n## *! Humans are born prematurely relative to their mammal counterparts*\n\nHumans emerge from the womb like molten glass from a furnace. They can be spun, stretched and shaped with a surprising degree of freedom. This is why today we can educate our children to become Christian or Buddhist, capitalist or socialist, warlike or peace-loving. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00ICN066A\u0026location=212))\n\n---\n\nThe appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00ICN066A\u0026location=371))\n\n---\n\nAccording to this theory Homo sapiens is primarily a social animal. Social cooperation is our key for survival and reproduction. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00ICN066A\u0026location=392))\n\n## *! Humans are social beings*\n\nThe alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition. These coalitions play a central part not only during overt struggles for the alpha position, but in almost all day-to-day activities. Members of a coalition spend more time together, share food, and help one another in times of trouble. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00ICN066A\u0026location=439))\n\n---\n\nBut once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00ICN066A\u0026location=462))\n\n---\n\nLarge numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths.

On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as the United States and Google.

([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=57))\n\n---\n\nIf we forget about genius and think more about how we can nurture and contribute to a scenius, we can adjust our own expectations and the expectations of the worlds we want to accept us. We can stop asking what others can do for us, and start asking what we can do for others. ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=62))\n\n---\n\nWriter David Foster Wallace said that he thought good nonfiction was a chance to “watch somebody reasonably bright but also reasonably average pay far closer attention and think at far more length about all sorts of different stuff than most of us have a chance to in our daily lives.” Amateurs fit the same bill: They’re just regular people who get obsessed by something and spend a ton of time thinking out loud about it. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=83))\n\n---\n\nThe world is changing at such a rapid rate that it’s turning us all into amateurs. Even for professionals, the best way to flourish is to retain an amateur’s spirit and embrace uncertainty and the unknown. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=91))\n\n---\n\nThe best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others. Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of what they’re not sharing. Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=97))\n\n---\n\nShare what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=101))\n\n---\n\nBecome a documentarian of what you do. Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages in your process. Shoot video of you working. This isn’t about making art, it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you. Take advantage of all the cheap, easy tools at your disposal—these days, most of us carry a fully functional multimedia studio around in our smartphones. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=197))\n\n---\n\nDon’t worry about everything you post being perfect. Science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon once said that 90 percent of everything is crap. The same is true of our own work. The trouble is, we don’t always know what’s good and what sucks. That’s why it’s important to get things in front of others and see how they react. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=235))\n\n---\n\nOf course, don’t let sharing your work take precedence over actually doing your work. If you’re having a hard time balancing the two, just set a timer for 30 minutes. Once the timer goes off, kick yourself off the Internet and get back to work. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=243))\n\n---\n\nIf you’re unsure about whether to share something, let it sit for 24 hours. Put it in a drawer and walk out the door. The next day, take it out and look at it with fresh eyes. Ask yourself, “Is this helpful? Is it entertaining? Is it something I’d be comfortable with my boss or my mother seeing?” There’s nothing wrong with saving things for later. The save as draft button is like a prophylactic—it might not feel as good in the moment, but you’ll be glad you used it in the morning. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=261))\n\n---\n\nDon’t think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine. Online, you can become the person you really want to be. Fill your website with your work and your ideas and the stuff you care about. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=295))\n\n---\n\nIf you happened to be wealthy and educated and alive in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, it was fashionable to have a Wunderkammern, a “wonder chamber,” or a “cabinet of curiosities” in your house—a room filled with rare and remarkable objects that served as a kind of external display of your thirst for knowledge of the world. Inside a cabinet of curiosities you might find books, skeletons, jewels, shells, art, plants, minerals, taxidermy specimens, stones, or any other exotic artifact. These collections often juxtaposed both natural and human-made marvels, revealing a kind of mash-up of handiwork by both God and human beings. They were the precursors to what we think of today as the modern museum—a place dedicated to the study of history, nature, and the arts. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=309))\n\n---\n\nThere’s not as big of a difference between collecting and creating as you might think. A lot of the writers I know see the act of reading and the act of writing as existing on opposite ends of the same spectrum: The reading feeds the writing, which feeds the reading. “I’m basically a curator,” says the writer and former bookseller Jonathan Lethem. “Making books has always felt very connected to my bookselling experience, that of wanting to draw people’s attention to things that I liked, to shape things that I liked into new shapes.” ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=319))\n\n---\n\nOur tastes make us what we are, but they can also cast a shadow over our own work. “All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste,” says public radio personality Ira Glass. “But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer.” Before we’re ready to take the leap of sharing our own work with the world, we can share our tastes in the work of others. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=323))\n\n---\n\nHuman beings want to know where things came from, how they were made, and who made them. The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel and what they understand about your work, and how people feel and what they understand about your work affects how they value it. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=399))\n\n---\n\nThe way to get over the awkwardness in these situations is to stop treating them as interrogations, and start treating them as opportunities to connect with somebody by honestly and humbly explaining what it is that you do. You should be able to explain your work to a kindergartner, a senior citizen, and everybody in between. Of course, you always need to keep your audience in mind: The way you explain your work to your buddies at the bar is not the way you explain your work to your mother. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=448))\n\n---\n\nBest of all, when you share your knowledge and your work with others, you receive an education in return. Author Christopher Hitchens said that the great thing about putting out a book is that “it brings you into contact with people whose opinions you should have canvassed before you ever pressed pen to paper. They write to you. They telephone you. They come to your bookstore events and give you things to read that you should have read already.” He said that having his work out in the world was “a free education that goes on for a lifetime.” ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=502))\n\n---\n\n“When people realize they’re being listened to, they tell you things.” —Richard Ford ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=508))\n\n---\n\nNo matter how famous they get, the forward-thinking artists of today aren’t just looking for fans or passive consumers of their work, they’re looking for potential collaborators, or co-conspirators. These artists acknowledge that good work isn’t created in a vacuum, and that the experience of art is always a two-way street, incomplete without feedback. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=521))\n\n---\n\nIf you want fans, you have to be a fan first. If you want to be accepted by a community, you have to first be a good citizen of that community. ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=532))\n\n---\n\nMake stuff you love and talk about stuff you love and you’ll attract people who love that kind of stuff. It’s that simple. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=551))\n\n---\n\nBrancusi practiced what I call The Vampire Test. It’s a simple way to know who you should let in and out of your life. If, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire. Of course, The Vampire Test works on many things in our lives, not just people—you can apply it to jobs, hobbies, places, etc. Vampires cannot be cured. Should you find yourself in the presence of a vampire, be like Brancusi, and banish it from your life forever. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=563))\n\n---\n\nWhen you put your work out into the world, you have to be ready for the good, the bad, and the ugly. The more people come across your work, the more criticism you’ll face. Here’s how to take punches: Relax and breathe. The trouble with imaginative people is that we’re good at picturing the worst that could happen to us. Fear is often just the imagination taking a wrong turn. Bad criticism is not the end of the world. As far as I know, no one has ever died from a bad review. Take a deep breath and accept whatever comes. (Consider practicing meditation—it works for me.) ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=608))\n\n---\n\nYou have to remember that your work is something you do, not who you are. This is especially hard for artists to accept, as so much of what they do is personal. Keep close to your family, friends, and the people who love you for you, not just the work. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=622))\n\n---\n\nDo you have a troll problem? Use the block button on social media sites. Delete nasty comments. My wife is fond of saying, “If someone took a dump in your living room, you wouldn’t let it sit there, would you?” Nasty comments are the same—they should be scooped up and thrown in the trash. ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=639))\n\n---\n\nThe model is very simple: They give away great stuff on their sites, they collect emails, and then when they have something remarkable to share or sell, they send an email. You’d be amazed at how well the model works. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=690))\n\n---\n\nYou just have to be as generous as you can, but selfish enough to get your work done. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=725))\n\n---\n\nSinger/songwriter Joni Mitchell says that whatever she feels is the weak link in her last project gives her inspiration for the next. ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=758))\n\n---\n\nThe designer Stefan Sagmeister swears by the power of the sabbatical—every seven years, he shuts down his studio and takes a year off. His thinking is that we dedicate the first 25 years or so of our lives to learning, the next 40 to work, and the last 15 to retirement, so why not take 5 years off retirement and use them to break up the work years? He says the sabbatical has turned out to be invaluable to his work: “Everything that we designed in the seven years following the first sabbatical had its roots in thinking done during that sabbatical.” ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=769))\n\n---\n\n“Anyone who isn’t embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn’t learning enough,” writes author Alain de Botton. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=795))\n\n---\n\nSo don’t think of it as starting over. Think of it as beginning again. Go back to chapter one—literally!—and become an amateur. Look for something new to learn, and when you find it, dedicate yourself to learning it out in the open. Document your progress and share as you go so that others can learn along with you. Show your work, and when the right people show up, pay close attention to them, because they’ll have a lot to show you. ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=806))\n\n---\n\nAlmost all of the people I look up to and try to steal from today, regardless of their profession, have built sharing into their routine. These people aren’t schmoozing at cocktail parties; they’re too busy for that. They’re cranking away in their studios, their laboratories, or their cubicles, but instead of maintaining absolute secrecy and hoarding their work, they’re open about what they’re working on, ([Location 26](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=26))\n\n---\n\nImagine turning a side project or a hobby into your profession because you had a following that could support you. ([Location 39](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=39))\n\n---\n\nThe real gap is between doing nothing and doing something.” Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing. ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=80))\n- Note: Words I need to live by. 70% of life is showing up. I am better than I see myself\n\n---\n\nIf all this sounds scary or like a lot of work, consider this: One day you’ll be dead. Most of us prefer to ignore this most basic fact of life, but thinking about our inevitable end has a way of putting everything into perspective.

Care less if people think I'm an idiot.\n\n---\n\nTry it: Start reading the obituaries every morning. Take inspiration from the people who muddled through life before you—they all started out as amateurs, and they got where they were going by making do with what they were given, and having the guts to put themselves out there. Follow their example.

There is some benefit to keeping some things secret. Some things are not nearly as exciting once you know the secrets of how they are performed. A recent one for me was Youtube editing. Until recently, I just watched and was along for the ride. Now I'm analyzing and looking for tricks.\n\n---\n\nBy letting go of our egos and sharing our process, we allow for the possibility of people having an ongoing connection with us and our work, which helps us move more of our product.

Once I gave myself a list of things I could focus my attention on without having to make any decisions, my time in Zombie Mode went from completely wasted to productive. Even though I am only getting routine and brainless tasks done during that time, it is a vast improvement over getting nothing done at all.

Yeah. Well, well, one of the ways I'm thinking about it, because I'm, I was writing the chapter about this in the book like this week, last week. I intended to do this week as well, but then time going, like, like, like, like. Yeah. Like systems of, I don't know. I feel like, I feel like all, all of the stuff converges on a few central, central themes admit and we as productivity writers try to put our own stamp on like a thing which people have been doing for centuries, not millennia. But that aside, what I'm, what I really like is, is that if I kind of break down my implicit process of goal setting, because it's never been like explicit. If I, if I break down what that looked like, what it looked like was step number one, setting a kind of destination goal that is within my control, like write a book I'm proud of, just like this big product, big project. Maybe in my mind, it's like, it would be really cool if it hits the best analyst. It would be really cool if I get invited on conferences. And if I, I don't know, get on a podcast because that, that, that would be sick. But like those are outside of my control. So I mean, just not think about those. Yeah. And just recognize that actually it's a, you know, a preferred and different as, as the Stoics might, might say, right. So the, the destination goal is within my control. And then I'll break that down into the kind of, quote, journey goals, which are, is more the system stuff of therefore what I like tangibly need to do is that every week or every day I want to aim to write X thousand words or X hundred words. And again, that is within my control. And then kind of my step three of this three step process is ([Time 0:03:34](https://share.snipd.com/snip/63575c33-6031-4afd-b04d-0772cce98f13))\n\n[Ensure destination goals are within your control](../Ensure%20destination%20goals%20are%20within%20your%20control.md)\n\n---\n\nAiming to do things daily ish\nKey takeaways:\n(\\* It is within the control of the individual to set and achieve goals., * It is important to lower the bar of quality when aiming to write, in order to make it easier to achieve., * It is important to do things regularly, such as meditation, in order to achieve a state of flow.)\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nBut like those are outside of my control.

And again, that is within my control. And then kind of my step three of this three step process is for that journey goal that like let's say I want to write 500 words a day to lower the bar of quality as much as possible. Yeah. I want like, I literally wrote my to do list, write 500 crappy words for crappy first draft of chapter two.\nSpeaker 1\nAnd I find that putting the words crappy in there twice really makes it easier to be okay, you know what, this is actually, it's actually doable. Do it. Yeah. Let's do this. And it makes me think of two other things like Dan Harris, meditation writer and the podcaster talks about doing things specifically meditation, aiming to do them daily ish and having this built in built in fuzziness like, because you know whether you did something daily ish like in a given week, you have a feel like if you did it twice, there wasn't daily ish, but it but it reduces this kind of like, oh, if I break my streak, it's all over and I might as well spend the next three weeks not doing anything.

In such a system, I might: Sit down to my morning writing and see a small handful of writing prompts for the day, drawn from my writing inbox I can choose to append whatever’s top of mind about any of them (perhaps they obscure what was written previously until I’ve added new material) Once I’ve done that, I can mark the prompt as “fruitful,” meaning it’ll come up again relatively soon, or “unfruitful,” in which case the system will increase its interval substantially. Alternately, I might take a moment to convert one of these prompts into one or more Evergreen notes. Any prompts which I simply ignore will have their intervals increased, but perhaps not as substantially as explicitly-unfruitful prompts. By taking advantage of the exponential nature of spaced repetition intervals, one could make incremental progress on potentially hundreds of prompts, while considering only a few on any given day. This would represent a system for incremental thinking.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.138033611-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Special-Superhuman-Part-II-Designing-Software-to-Feel-Like-a-Game":{"title":"Special —  Superhuman Part II - Designing Software to Feel Like a Game","content":"\n# Special —  Superhuman Part II - Designing Software to Feel Like a Game\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Acquired*\n* Full Title: Special —  Superhuman Part II - Designing Software to Feel Like a Game\n* URL: https://share.snipd.com/episode/9e3bf147-8252-43e5-bdfb-4f2e3ff0b210\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nPodcast - Episode 2 - Raoul and Gabriel\nSummary:\nraoul.

It would be really hard to experience fun but not pleasure, he says. There are plenty of pleasant experiences that few people would describe as fun. So it turns out that pleasure alone misses a certain something special.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nAnd so kind of introspective interrogation can lead you to a really good definition. But you can go deeper still. So, for example, i'm fiddling with a piece of paper right now. I'm rolling it up and i'm unrolling it, just in order to keep my nervousness down. Now you could say, i'm playing with it, but it's not a very fun toy. So you could also then observe that some toys are more fun than others. Ad then you start to get to a definition like, a game is something you play. A toy is an object you play with, but a good toy is an object that is fun to play with. And then you start to get to the heart of the matter, which is, well, what is fun anyway? And again, there's been a tun of research into what fun actually is. Some people would say, fun is just pleasure. To them. I would say, well, can you experience fun but not pleasure? And the answer seems yet, probably not. It would be really hard to experience fun but not pleasure. I can't think of an example where that's the case. But the contrapositive is not true. There are plenty of pleasant experiences. Imagine, for example, the relaxing head massage that few people would describe as fun. So it turns out that pleasure alone misses a certain something special. And the thing that it misses is surprise.

A good toy is an object that is fun to play with and fun is pleasant surprise. The classic definition on this is previous acquired guessd nolan bushnell's law. There are plenty of other things that are required in order to make a good game.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nBut the contrapositive is not true. There are plenty of pleasant experiences. Imagine, for example, the relaxing head massage that few people would describe as fun. So it turns out that pleasure alone misses a certain something special. And the thing that it misses is surprise. It turns out that fun needs surprise. And in fact, our brain is hard wired, in a very neuro logical sense, to enjoy surprise. So wend up with this stack of definitions. A game is something you play. A good toy is an object that is fun to play with. And fun is pleasant surprise. Aha, well, perfect. That is exactly what our next question was going to be, which is a, in some ways, i think, the crux of the matter here, which is, what is a good game? Af course, the classic definition on this is previous acquired guessd nolan bushnell, fromatari bushnell's law, that a good game is something that is easy to learn, but difficult to master.

So, as you know, i sold my last company, reportive, to lincton. And being at lincton was an easy being acquired, so to speak, is is rather hard.

We can be less enthused to do a thing once for being extrinsically motivated. This is why, sometimes if you take some one who has a hobby and then you pay them to do it, they start to lose interest in the hobby. And there was a fascinating study that i think we should go into, because it really outlines this in the clearest way possible. Back in the nineteen seventies, researches from stanford, they'd recruited children. These were young kids. They were aged about three to four years old. Now the thing that made all of these kids in common is that they were generally interested in drawing. And some of these kids were told they would get a reward, a certificate with a gold seal and a ribbon. And some of these kids were not told about any reward, and so they did not expect one, or even know of one. Now, the researchers then invited all of these children into a separate room to draw for six minutes. And then afterwards, they would either get the reward or not, depending on which group they were in. And over the next few days, the children were observed to see how much they would continue to draw by themselves. Now here's the thing, the children with no reward spent seventeen per cent of their time drawing. But the children who expected a reward, the ones who had received compensation, so to speak, they only spent eight per cent of their time drawing. In other words, the extrinsic reward had literally arved their motivation. So you can back out of this into intrinsic motivation, into extrinsic motivation.

In other words, the extrinsic reward had literally arved their motivation. So you can back out of this into intrinsic motivation, into extrinsic motivation. And the definitions are as follows. With intrinsic motivation, we do things because they are inherently interesting and satisfying. With extrinsic motivation, we do things to earn rewards and achieve external goals. And that's the problem with rewards. They massively undermine intrinsic motivation. And that's why gamification does not work.

They have a zero risk replacement guarantee.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nO k, acquired, listeners, we have a new sponsor to tell you about to day on this special lemon dot i o. Now, what is lemon i o? It is the perfect place for start ups to hire vedid remote developers from eastern in our era of working remote, i, you know, can't think of a time where this is more relevant and more common on basically every team i work with to have folks in other countries contributing to building the product. Lemon io, for folks who have dealt with different sorts of ways to out source development before, you should check out their web sight. Go to lemon dot io. Actually, slash acquired, and i'll tll you about a little deal here at the end. You can almost just tell by the of their web sit it's just a really, really fun brand and cool company. The best time to use lemonio is when you're a technical co founder and just starting and need to delegate some of the work. You may need to do a specific technology or use a specific code base, but you don't have that skill on your team, and you don't want to just hire someone for a six week project. You may also be growing and need to add more developers to be able to just run faster. With lemoni o, it's much cheaper to hire engineers than with other outsourcing options. The quality is also excellent. They rigorously test and interview every developer, eliminating the risk of a failed project. They have a zero risk replacement guarantee. They match you with the best candidate within twenty four hours. So it's a super quick, painless process. Of course, my favorite thing about lemon and any of the other sponsors on the show they are of the acquired community. So we had some one reach out because they're a listener to the show, they're just like you, and they they like hearing about company stories. So here's the deal, if you want a fifteen per cent discount for the first six weeks of work for all acquired listeners, you can go to lemon dot i o slash acquired to claim the offer.

And my question is, like, being someone who thinks so deeply about all these very nuanced emotions as you are designing the product, does it translate to your personal life? Like, do you notice yourself as a human by studying this stuff, that you are more aware of your nuanced emotions? Or are they totally separate? And this is more of an analytical skill verses something that would just sort of naturally start happening to you as a person?\nSpeaker 1\nIt's funny you should mention that, because, yes, it does definitely help in personal relationships, whether those are happening at work or at home. One of the things that i strongly advise any founder to go through is conflict training, or training on how to give feed bulk, or how to give dificult feedback, or how to receive difficult feedback. And for customers ore superhuman, i have recently sent out a news letter just how to do this. One of the things that i focus really hard on is separating the objective description of the behaviour upon which i'm trying to give feedback.

I once heard the cartoonist Gary Panter say, “If you have one person you’re influenced by, everyone will say you’re the next whoever. But if you rip off a hundred people, everyone will say you’re so original!” ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0074QGGK6\u0026location=173))\n\n---\n\nWhat to copy is a little bit trickier. Don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes. The reason to copy your heroes and their style is so that you might somehow get a glimpse into their minds.

But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized he couldn’t completely pull them off because he didn’t have the same body type as the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his own. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0074QGGK6\u0026location=187))\n\n---\n\nSo: Copy your heroes.

Write the kind of story you like best—write the story you want to read. The same principle applies to your life and your career: Whenever you’re at a loss for what move to make next, just ask yourself, “What would make a better story?” ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0074QGGK6\u0026location=218))\n\n---\n\nThe manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use—do the work you want to see done.

Step 2: Invite others to wonder with you. You should wonder at the things nobody else is wondering about. If everybody’s wondering about apples, go wonder about oranges.

So, I ride the bus to and from work, even though it’s 20 minutes faster to drive. I go to a barbershop that’s first-come, first-served, without Wi-Fi, and always busy with a wait of a few hours.

It’s pretty wonderful. And disorienting. And a major high. But I always know that high will taper off, and a few weeks down the road I will have a dark day when I want to quit, when I wonder why the heck I even bother with this stuff. That’s why I put every really nice e-mail I get in a special folder. (Nasty e-mails get deleted immediately.) When those dark days roll around and I need a boost, I open that folder and read through a couple e-mails. Then I get back to work.

It seems contradictory, but when it comes to creative work, limitations mean freedom. Write a song on your lunch break. Paint a painting with only one color. Start a business without any start-up capital. Shoot a movie with your iPhone and a few of your friends. Build a machine out of spare parts. Don’t make excuses for not working—make things with the time, space, and materials you have, right now.

As he states, “Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.” ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B09LRRQ1XF\u0026location=744)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nWhen you have an email list, it’s a great idea to make sure the first email people get from you is full of value and delivers a quick win—ideally something they can do in less than five minutes.

The method involves going to Amazon, looking up books related to your topic, then using the free preview to examine the table of contents. You’re not copying the table of contents, but using it as inspiration for the kinds of content you should be creating and sharing with your audience.

A great way to do this is through a “getting started” page on your website. ([Location 796](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B09LRRQ1XF\u0026location=796)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nStep 1 Audit all the places in your brand where your audience first hears from you. First, identify the different ways and places people hear from you after initiating their relationship with you—the first email they receive or the getting started page on your website is a good place to start. Step 2 Ask, does what I share in this email or on this page provide the person with a quick win . . . or am I just hitting them with more information? Step 3 Brainstorm ways you could transform the content of that page or email to give the person a small, quick win. And if that email or page already contains guidance on getting a quick win, how could you make that win more impactful or quicker to achieve (or both)? ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B09LRRQ1XF\u0026location=808)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nThere are two aspects to this strategy: painting a picture of the future of what life will be like if they DO take action with you, and what life will be like if they DON’T. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B09LRRQ1XF\u0026location=835)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nYou see, your audience won’t be buying your product or service—they’ll be buying the change that product or service offers them. They’ll be buying the way it will help them transform their lives. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B09LRRQ1XF\u0026location=858)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nGather at least five stories that show how what you teach or provide can help change people’s lives or businesses (or both!) for the better. Ask people to give you the before (what their life was like before they learned from you or worked with you), the after (what their life was like after doing so), and the what if (what life would be like if they hadn’t followed your advice). Step 2 Incorporate these stories into the messages you share with your audience. Think of five specific ways you can share these stories, whether that’s in a blog article or in a podcast episode ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B09LRRQ1XF\u0026location=889)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nDon’t leave anyone hanging.

Then, I’d send them an email thanking them for the comment and complimenting them on their article, pointing out something specific I enjoyed about it.

Now, you might be worried that by asking for an answer it may seem like you don’t know the answer yourself. That’s not true. You’re simply allowing your audience to talk amongst each other, which you may find to be valuable, not just for the reasons above, but because—guess what—your audience likely knows a thing or two!

It’s like inviting your entire audience into your “writers’ room,” where they can share their opinions on where the story should go—and connect with each other in that process of storytelling. It also works really well when you ask people to answer a question that doesn’t have an obvious, “correct” answer.

I do agree with that. At linkton, i ran all o our email integrations. It was my responsibility rather to get linkton data, lincton profiles, into other male clients. And so i became very familiar with how professionals do their email, and the t l d r is badly. So i took a year off after i left. And during that time, i was looking for what i wanted to start next. Due in part to the ipo and to the acquisition, i was very fortunate to be in a position where i didn't really have to work. And so i focused on impact. You know, what was the biggest thing that i could possibly do? And my mind kept going back to a two thousand and 12 mackenzie study, where they showed that the average professional, and there are one billion professionals in the world, the average professional spends three hours a day reading and writing email\nSpeaker 2\nYouow, it's not harar to beliefralis crazy.\nSpeaker 1\nIt's, i mean, it's, it's just mind blowing.

And i think, as i introspect this. It came out of some of the frustrations developing reportive on gmal. Obviously, gmal, at the time, was my primary emal inter face. I was the founder and seo of a of that start up, and i was doing a lot of email based work. And so i was intimately familiar with how slow g merle was and how slow it was gettingnd i had therefore this this hunch, this inkling, that speed was going to be a very big deal. But like with any hunch or inkling, one does have to validate it. So in the first year of superhuman, as we were primarily building, we threw up a a landing page. It was a terrible landing page, just basic square space thing that took us all of two hours to put together. And all you could do on this page was throw in your email address. D when you threw in your email address, you got an automatic email from me. And in that email, there were two questions. Number one was, what do you use for email to day? And number two was, what were your pet peaves about it? And i had two hypotheses going in. Hypothesis number one was that for g mal, people were upset about how slow it had got, and how it wasn't working properly off line, and how they had to use gmal pluggins to make it do the things that they wanted to do.

The best way to do it is to pick one or two events per year where you can insert yourself into the cultural seitgeist. So for us, one such event was when mail box was being shut down. But it was the perfect narrative to say, hey, i'm over here. Come come look.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nI feel for you. Ha, ha. So we had to validate that. In that first year of superhuman i think that we had maybe in the region of five thousand sinups on that landing page, five thousand emales that went out, a thousand conversations that actually happened, therefore, a thousand interviews that i did with early users. Probably weigh more than most founders would actually do. And resoundingly, those two hypotheses were confirmed. People disliked gima for the speed and the lack of off line and the clutter and the pluggins. And people disliked third party emal aps because of the stability and the sink and the bugginess.\nSpeaker 2\nHow did you drive traffic?

The only way to win, and i think it's read hoffman who popularized the following statement, is to be contrarian and right. And there's nothing more contrario against a free product than to charge s as much as seems reasonable, but then to back it up with the goods that actually make it worth while.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 2\nBefore we get into kind of our discussion, i want to talk about a kind of a provocative question. Have we reached the end of the era of the mvp? Or ship a crapy version? But before we get there, for listeners who don't know, superhuman cost, 30 dollars a month for an emal client, like, talk about a narrative violation. This is, i think, the last browser that tried to charge for you to use was, like, omni web in, you know, the early two thousands. And i think it would be absolute heresy to day to say, oh, you know it? It's not even a male service. It's backed by gmal. It's an application through which to interface with with gml. But boy is it great. And, oh my gosh, i pay 30, 30 dollars for it. How did you come to a revenue model of were just goingto ask people to pay? How did you pick a price point and how you validate it?\nSpeaker 1\nI think overall, with pricing strategy, you have to analyze what you're going up against. And we were going up against free, or nearly free. Gml and microsoft are practically free, ifo are a consumer. And if you're in the enterprise, it's being paid for you anyway, so you don't see or feel the cost. The only way to win, and i think it's read hoffman who popularized the following statement, is to be contrarian and right. I don't necessarily know how to be right, but i do know how to mai.

Most start ups are trying to take advantage of a first mover effect or greenfield effects. We may as well price as low as we can to get em all exactly. So i think we should come back to that point because i have a thing that i should probably share with the listeners. But just to tie the positioning back into the pricing, cause this is he very methodical exercise that we ran through.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 1\nVery much the latter. So i think we should come back to that point because i have a, have a thing that i should probably share with the listeners. But just to tie the positioning back into the pricing, cause this is he very methodical exercise that we ran through. So to step one is understand the lay of the competitive environment. In our case, we were going up against ae two incumbents whose products are free, or practically free. Step two is come up with the positioning like i just described. And when you read our positioning, it's clear that superhuman is a premium tool for a premium market. And step three is develop your pricing. Now there are many, many ways to develop pricing. But one of the easiest ways, this will appeal to the business school guy and you, is e the van westendor pricing sensitivity meter. I see head nods going on over here. Don't take a fancy name. I it's just some dude's name, i think. A ha ha, ha ha. He was probably very smart, very clever, did a lot of pricing. Anyway, so he said, ask your target users four questions. Number one, at what price would you consider superhuman to be so expensive that you would not consider buying im? Two, at what price would you consider superhuman to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn't be very good? Num three, at what price would you consider superhuman to be starting to get expensive, so that it isn't out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it? Ant number four, at what price would you consider superhuman to be a bargain, a great buy for the money? Now, most start ups actually orient around the fourth question, bargain for the money, because there's some kind of network effect, or a greenfield effect, or they're trying to take advantage of a first mover effect, or so on, till there's a land gad they want to get all the usures.\nSpeaker 2\nWe may as well price as low as we can to get em all exactly.

So for listeners, i want to set the stage on sort of a time line for this whole thing, because i do think it's kind of crazy how long it waited before seeing the light of day.

I wrote the landing page before i did anything else. All of the copy that you see on superhuman dot com is actually copy that was written in january of 20 15. And i created hundreds of detailed wire frames. And the first line of code was not written until may fourth in 20 15.

There are things you can do even when you you don't have a team. What i did in c four was i bought superhuman dot com, and i raised about a 750 thousand dollars of seed capital. And then in january, i did the wire frame that in february, i engaged with a design agency to make those wide frames into really beautiful mocups, hiodel mocups.\nSpeaker 2\nI think that's a little bit of a contrarian thing, to bring in a design agency sort of that early and in a start up, rather than hiring a designer or doing it in house.\nSpeaker 1\nIt isand it turned out to be super expensive compared to hiring a designer. I think i spent forty five thousand as on turning these wire frames into high fidelity mock ups. I do, speaking of frameworks, i do have a framework on this, which explains why i think it was the rational thing to do in my case. If you want to hear somethingcrt, so i think the the fundamental job of a founder is to create momentum.

Because i had anced the pain that we were trying to solve when i was running my last company. I very clearly could see, oh, we haven't solved that pain, not yet. I could feel ourselves getting closer every single day. But i had to find a way to explain this to the team. You know, these are hyperambitious, superintelligent engineers and designers and people of all discipline who'd poured their hearts and souls into the product. They needed a way to understand, not only that, we weren't ready, but how not ready we were, or how close we were, and the precise steps that we could do in order to get there. So i went out and about. I read everything i could find, and i started searching for definitions of product market fit. And there's quite a few out there. So for example, paul graham would say, it's when you made something people wantd i think that's a pretty good definition. But i wanted something more actionable. And i think sam altman had a slightly different take, which is, it's when users love your product so much that they spontaneously tell other people to start using it, without you even asking them to do that. And that's a different take on it. So peg's take is around desire. Sam's take as around a distribution or a sort of net promotion.

You can either build something that a large number of people want a small amount, or something that a small number of people wants a large amount. In other words, don't worry too much about building for a narrow segment of users and therefore over fitting. It's not good start up ideas but nearly all good start-up ideas are of that type.\nTranscript:\nSpeaker 3\nI mean, he said, as stare ad se briiman, he wasn't grimly determined. Was now grimly determined, ok, sir.\nSpeaker 1\nStart up ideas. He says, when a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making, not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed, and that could be built with the amount of effort that a start up usually puts into version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to compromise on one dimension. You can either build something that a large number of people want a small amount, or something that a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good start up ideas, but nearly all good start up ideas are of that type. In other words, what he's saying is, don't worry too much about building for a narrow segment of users and therefore over fitting.

Anything that scores 3–5, i.e. “as expected” to “much easier than expected”, should be considered a “satisfied” user experience.\nFor CES to be most effective, our surveys should target only our retained users. This allows us to understand if there are any hidden problems not reflected in the features retention while focusing on improving retention independently.

Being called white felt like the worst insult in the world, not because I thought being white was inherently bad, but because that accusation existed to erase my Blackness. Why should I ever want to be white like them? The statement was, of course, intended as a compliment. They were not trying to harm me; they were trying to explain why and how much they liked me. They aspired to no longer see me as Black, and they would become defensive when I reminded them that I was. Eventually, it became clear to me that I did not have the language to describe these friends. What is the word for a well-meaning person whose language, whose very ideas are not intentionally, but inherently, racist? Whose idea of a compliment is a grave insult built upon cultural erasure.

When we plant a rose seed in the earth, we notice that it is small, but we do not criticize it as “rootless and stemless.” We treat it as a seed, giving it the water and nourishment required of a seed. When it first shoots up out of the earth, we don’t condemn it as immature and underdeveloped; nor do we criticize the buds for not being open when they appear. We stand in wonder at the process taking place and give the plant the care it needs at each stage of its development. The rose is a rose from the time it is a seed to the time it dies. Within it, at all times, it contains its whole potential.

Ironically, the overtightening of these muscles has the opposite effect on power. It reduces power, by making it more difficult for the wrist and elbow to release freely.

The surfer waits for the big wave because he values the challenge it presents. He values the obstacles the wave puts between him and his goal of riding the wave to the beach. Why? Because it is those very obstacles, the size and churning power of the wave, which draw from the surfer his greatest effort. It is only against the big waves that he is required to use all his skill, all his courage and concentration to overcome; only then can he realize the true limits of his capacities. At that point he often attains his peak. In other words, the more challenging the obstacle he faces, the greater the opportunity for the surfer to discover and extend his true potential.

Each player tries his hardest to defeat the other, but in this use of competition it isn’t the other person we are defeating; it is simply a matter of overcoming the obstacles he presents. In true competition no person is defeated. Both players benefit by their efforts to overcome the obstacles presented by the other.

The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere. All successful startup processes should be geared to accelerate that feedback loop. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004J4XGN6\u0026location=201))\n- Note: I would argue there is a learning step prior to the build step to save time and money\n\n---\n\nWhen I worked as a programmer, that meant eight straight hours of programming without interruption. That was a good day. In contrast, if I was interrupted with questions, process, or—heaven forbid—meetings, I felt bad. What did I really accomplish that day? Code and product features were tangible to me; I could see them, understand them, and show them off. Learning, by contrast, is frustratingly intangible. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004J4XGN6\u0026location=285))\n- Note: This is how a feel these days. I need to find a way to track and document our learnings. We also have to get out our four walls more.\n\n---\n\nI wish I could say that I was the one to realize our mistake and suggest the solution, but in truth, I was the last to admit the problem. In short, our entire strategic analysis of the market was utterly wrong. We figured this out empirically, through experimentation, rather than through focus groups or market research. Customers could not tell us what they wanted; most, after all, had never heard of 3D avatars. Instead, they revealed the truth through their action or inaction as we struggled to make the product better. ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004J4XGN6\u0026location=581))\n\n---\n\nLean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste.

([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004J4XGN6\u0026location=685))\n- Note: I identify with this, but perhaps steer our customers too much.\n\n---\n\nthe right way to think about productivity in a startup: not in terms of how much stuff we are building but in terms of how much validated learning we’re getting for our efforts. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004J4XGN6\u0026location=694))\n\n---\n\nThese are some of the questions teams struggle to answer if they have followed the “let’s just ship a product and see what happens” plan. I call this the “just do it” school of entrepreneurship after Nike’s famous slogan.1 Unfortunately, if the plan is to see what happens, a team is guaranteed to succeed—at seeing what happens—but won’t necessarily gain validated learning. This is one of the most important lessons of the scientific method: if you cannot fail, you cannot learn.

([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004J4XGN6\u0026location=829))\n\n---\n\nFor the growth hypothesis, which tests how new customers will discover a product or service, we can do a similar analysis. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004J4XGN6\u0026location=835))\n\n---\n\nInstead, I try to push my team to first answer four questions: 1. Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve? 2. If there was a solution, would they buy it? 3. Would they buy it from us? 4. Can we build a solution for that problem?” ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004J4XGN6\u0026location=872))\n- Note: Key line of thinking and communication\n\n---\n\nHe explained, “Until we could figure out how to sell and make the product, it wasn’t worth spending any engineering time on.” ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B004J4XGN6\u0026location=882))\n\n---\n\nWhere customers complained about missing features, this suggested that the team was on the right track.

That way, when we look back at our notes, we can always tell which ideas are most exciting to a total beginner. This is often the stuff that’s most worth writing about. Here’s how the Novelty Index works in practice: Take a note when something interests or surprises you, (including when you strongly disagree with something). Write down a score (1-5) of how much it surprised or interested you at the time. Later on, use this ranking system to decide what ideas you should write about. If something was super-novel and exciting to you a few months ago (4 or 5 points), it’s probably a good topic to write about - even if your future self thinks “this is old news - why would I write about that?”.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.020717698-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-P.A.R.A.-System-and-the-Importance-of-Folders-RescueTime-Blog":{"title":"The P.A.R.A.

Then I'd start asking them questions about their business #status/review \n\n---\n\nTactic 1: Smile and Say Hi\nYes, it's really that easy. This has been my go-to opener for years with people. I walk up to someone, give them a warm smile, offer my hand out, and just say, \"Hi, I'm Sam! What's your name?\" If they've got a name tag, I'll ask something innocuous like, \"What brings you here?\" Like I said above, people love to feel welcomed and accepted. #status/review \n\n---\n\nTake, for example, a \"tech famous\" core team contributor of your favorite framework. That person gets bombarded daily with mostly criticism and sometimes abject flattery. Any time I meet someone whose software I use or whose book I loved, I simply smile, shake their hand, and say:\n\"Hi, I'm Sam. I just wanted to take a moment to thank you in person for the work you're doing. It really makes my life easier every day.\" #status/review \n\n---\n\nOnce you've expressed genuine appreciation, you need to master the art of finding common ground. Your best go-tos are always:\nHobbies (think board games or knitting)\nLocation (from the same small town in Ohio?)\nSchool (same high school, same college, rival college)\nEntertainment (here's your chance to talk about Harry Potter, or sports, or TV shows) #status/review \n\n---\n\nNever spend more than a few minutes in these interactions #status/review \n\n---\n\nTake a few minutes to get to know the person, and then say something like this:\n\"Hey, it was really great talking to you for a minute. I've got a few other people I want to be sure to catch before I take off. I'd love to keep in touch, though - do you have a card?\"\nI know, I know, we're in tech and people don't often carry cards. That's okay. The point is not the medium itself, the point is that I asked them for a means of following up. Do not just hand them a card or tell them your Twitter handle. They will never follow up with you #status/review \n\n---\n\nTactic 6: Follow Up (No one does this!)\nFollowing up is the single most important tactic here, but it requires the most skill. You have to learn how to follow up without being creepy or too persistent. Luckily, this is pretty straightforward.\nAfter a few days, but no more than a week, contact them in their preferred medium. It's this easy:\nSubject: Great meeting you! \\[keep it simple\\]\nHi Susan,\nJust wanted to send you a quick note to say that it was great meeting you at the Famous Tech Conference last week. I bet that Michigan weather is a tough adjustment after all that sunshine. \\[something personal about them\\]\nTake care, \\[courteous without being creepy\\] Sam Julien P.S. My friends are still trying to convince me to play Scythe, but I hear it's even more complicated than Netrunner. I'm doomed. \\[callback to whatever common connection you made\\]\nNotice I'm still not asking for a job or anything. I'm still building the relationship.\nIf they don't respond, that's fine. Not everyone has time to respond to every single email. Hopefully, they'll respond in a friendly tone with similar banter. If not, don't sweat it. #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.060149712-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Peloton-Experience-A-Usability-Heuristics-Analysis-by-Samantha-Rapa-Aug-2021-UX-Collective":{"title":"The Peloton Experience A Usability Heuristics Analysis  by Samantha Rapa  Aug, 2021  UX Collective","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Samantha Rapa*\n* Full Title: The Peloton Experience: A Usability Heuristics Analysis | by Samantha Rapa | Aug, 2021 | UX Collective\n* Category:\n* URL: https://uxdesign.cc/the-peloton-experience-c072e305fad6?cmdid=69CNJEXGR07ICX\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nThe first principle we look at is the Aesthetic-Usability Effect. Users tend to perceive an aesthetically pleasing design as more usable than its less attractive competitors. A positive response is triggered in people’s brains, causing them to think the design actually works better than it does\n- Note: [Design](../moc/Design.md)\n\n---\n\nVisibility of System Status heuristic states that the design should always keep users informed about what is going on. Appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time is important here, and Peloton does this throughout the user journey. During a workout class there is a bar at the top of the screen that shows where you are in the class at all times, but can be hidden if desired. Every button clicked shows appropriate, instant feedback.\n- Note: Should we show that the front end is connected and/or how long this chart has been open?\n.Design\n\n---\n\nHick’s Law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. Peloton recognizes this and uses a few techniques to counter this. When response times are most critical, they minimize choices. After a workout is complete, Peloton suggests a few cool down/post-workout class options for users to click quickly and efficiently after a workout without spending the time trying to select one of the many options for a post-workout\n\n---\n\nPeak-End Rule. This states that people judge an experience based largely on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than an average of how they felt throughout the entire experience. Peloton has placed most emphasis on the peak and end of the user’s journey. At the most intense point of the user journey, you are partaking in a class which is the most enjoyable part of the journey. At its end, you receive a reward for doing your personal best or making any achievements\n\n---\n\nGoal-Gradient effect states that the closer you get to a goal, the higher the tendency to approach that goal. Peloton employs two features to encourage users to complete more workouts in relation to this principle. The display of artificial progress helps ensure users will have more motivation to complete tasks. The progress bar at the top of the screen during a workout is broken down into segments, showing you when you’ve hit certain milestones\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.351140666-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Power-of-Physical-Reminders":{"title":"The Power of Physical Reminders","content":"\n# The Power of Physical Reminders\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://aliabdaal.com/content/images/size/w256h256/2020/06/favicon.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Ali Abdaal*\n* Full Title: The Power of Physical Reminders\n* URL: https://aliabdaal.com/the-power-of-physical-reminders/\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\n## **YouTube Clubs** \nA list of the 12 ‘types’ of video that I tend to make, including Tech Club, Health Club, Business Club, etc. If I ever get stuck thinking of a video idea, I glance at the list and ask myself ‘which of these have I not covered recently?’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnz44m4r705pcth53pbt0yag))\n![BKB 2023-01-08 at 10.30.43.png](../BKB%202023-01-08%20at%2010.30.43.png)\n![BKB 2023-01-08 at 10.31.20.png](../BKB%202023-01-08%20at%2010.31.20.png)\n\nYouTube Shorts can drive a lot of extra views, netting more subscribers who’ll get value from my long-form videos ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnz45gndmmhx88v1355atvwv))\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.143614023-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Problem-With-Not-Defining-Problems":{"title":"The Problem With Not Defining Problems","content":"\n# The Problem With Not Defining Problems\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*TGH72Nnw24QL3iV9IOm4VA.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Michael F.

This matters for two reasons. The obvious one is that whoever is wrong about the disagreement will improve their models of the world. The less obvious one is that both participants in the one-on-one get better at imagining what the other person would think about something, which is critical for building a high-trust working relationship. #status/review \n\n---\n\nUncertainties. The founders always encouraged me to use 1-on-1s to ask about anything I was uncertain about, even if it didn’t affect my day-to-day work. If anything, I spend more attention worrying about things that don’t affect my day-to-day work (because those are the things I can’t control), so I’d often end up a lot less stressed after these discussions. For the founders, I think these discussions helped them discover problems with internal communication—for instance, occasionally I’d get worried about some strategically important project elsewhere in the company because they’d forgotten to announce progress reports on it. #status/review \n\n---\n\nI also now think the “caring a lot” qualification is way more important than I used to. Lots of people (including Eve) try having “accountability buddies” that they meet with to discuss progress on their goals, and accountability buddies are rarely this effective. The main difference is that most accountability buddies don’t care about each other in the same way that managers/reports, or significant others, do: for me, Eve’s progress was the top idea in my mind in a way that I doubt it was for anyone else. Because of that, I ended up having more insightful feedback for her than a random “accountability buddy” might. #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-09T19:59:26.323022853-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-World-Is-Run-by-People-No-Smarter-Than-You":{"title":"The World Is Run by People No Smarter Than You","content":"\n# The World Is Run by People No Smarter Than You\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://www.swyx.io/swyx-ski.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *swyx.io blog*\n* Full Title: The World Is Run by People No Smarter Than You\n* URL: https://www.swyx.io/no-smarter\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nLife can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: **Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you** and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

Most creators and YouTube educators focus on Search and ranking, but for me, I look at it as a funnel for bringing in additional traffic. When you get the initial traffic on your content, you can turn it into consumption traffic, meaning you've converted your first‐time viewers into repeat consumers of your content.

For instance, I watch all videos at 2× speed. So on a 10:00 video, my AVD would be 5:00, but my AVP would be 100%. For long‐term channel growth, these two metrics are key.

For tags, use your primary and secondary keywords and other relevant words. Stay under 300 characters in your tags.

The same thing happened with another client: he uploaded a video, and it just wasn't performing well.

The Kickstart Question: What’s on your mind? This gets to the heart of the conversation. It’s another way of saying let’s talk about the thing that matters most.

Scrutinize your past self.**\nOne of my favorite exercises is the *failure resumé*, which I learned about from [Tina Seelig](http://www.tinaseelig.com/) at Stanford University. Many of us labor endlessly on our resumés, scrubbing and buffing them until they shine. That’s cool. The marketing department has a job to do. But the research and development department is feeling a little left out. So, when you’re done Turtle-Waxing your LinkedIn Profile, try Tina’s technique. Compile all your failures, screwups, missteps and blunders. List them in a single column on a spreadsheet or document. Then next to each flub, write — in a single sentence — the lesson you learned from it. I’ve done this. It wasn’t fun. But it delivered two important insights. First, in some cases, there *wasn’t* lesson to be learned. Solid decisions don’t always produce fantastic outcomes. Fortune is fickle. Shit happens. That can be a relief — a way to move forward, unburdened by the setback and better informed about the vicissitudes of life. Second, in compiling the failure resumé, I discovered that at the core of many of the screwups were the same two decision-making mistakes. The failure resumé surfaced the two mega-errors Past Dan had been making, which helped Future Dan avoid them.

Because typing is a [fine motor skill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_motor_skill) (it coordinates small muscle movements), it’s highly [feedback-dependent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control#Open_loop_control). However, the feedback is handled below the threshold of our conscious perception, so we don’t necessarily need to be aware of latency to be severely affected by it.

This can be useful for implementing responsive web design.\n• User preference is important, so do not stray too far from `font-size: 100%` and `1em`.\n• Use `rem` and `em` for `font-size`.\n• Use `rem`, `em`, or `%` for element positioning (`margin`, `padding`, etc).\n• Use `em` for media query dimensions.\n• For large headings or when text is grouped with an image, use [FitText](http://fittextjs.com/) to achieve scalable headlines. Stray away from `vw` and `vh` due to incomplete support, difficulty in precise configuration, and because it does not listen to browser font or zoom settings.

My framework for ensuring a blog post accomplishes both is to start with a first draft that focuses on \"novel\" ideas.\nA novel idea is one that's not just new to the reader, but also significant and not easily intuited. Think of it as new and *worthwhile*.

I would have never believed it.\"\n* **Elegant articulations** — \"Beautiful. I couldn't have said it better myself.\"\n* **Make someone feel seen** — \"Yes! That's exactly how I feel!\"\n  [Five Novelty Categories](../Five%20Novelty%20Categories.md)\n\n---\n\nNovelty is what gives readers dopamine hits. You find novel ideas by pursuing your curiosity and noting what interests and surprises you along the way. If it intrigues you, it'll likely intrigue your readers too.

That’s all that's needed to write with conviction: pair an objective with a motivation. When writers lack one of these, they tend to not finish their articles. If the right objective and motivation combo isn't coming right away, that's okay. Start writing like you would in a diary to uncover what's in the back of your head. As you write, a clear objective will eventually emerge. At that time, do a full rewrite with your clear objective as your guiding light. \n\n---\n\nWe write to clear our minds, reflect on our experiences, force ourselves to dive deeper, satisfy our curiosities, teach others, build reputation, and hone our craft.

I can't be honest with you and say i rationally think that they're in the sky, or or that their spirits or their energy is around me. It's so comforting to think about. I think that's, that's that really comforts you, like like a teddy bear comforts a child. But i don't think that it's actually there. I think it's a ideology that's there for comfort.

You can think about the way that Evan Williams at Twitter evolved on the concept of blogging, which he helped pioneer a blogger, you know, by reducing it to 140 characters. That was really the innovation. You know, it was whatever it was 140 characters and there was a follow model. Tumblr itself, you know, really was a what if there was a follow button on blogs and so on and so forth. You know, a lot of the things, what if you could order a taxi, but it wasn't you press the button on your phone. You know, they're these really what if you couldn't, you know, rent a hotel, but it was someone's home. These these transformations and how we use technology and interact with software as a society tend to be something that has existed for a long, long time with one or two really high leverage changes. And so Zuck's feedback to me was don't reinvent the wheel everywhere. Take something that has existed for a long, long time and reinvent it in the most important place that will change everything. That's easier said than done, of course, but I've kept that lesson with me and the teams I've worked with ever since then, which is try to just be surgical in what matters and reinventing the wheel in those places.
