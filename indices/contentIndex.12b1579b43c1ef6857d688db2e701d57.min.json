I enjoyed the ride and learned some skills along the way, but in no way was that what I set out to do.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.692124713-04:00","tags":null},"/Blloc-Ratio":{"title":"Blloc Ratio","content":"\nhttps://www.blloc.com/\n\n### Meta\n\n*Android Launchers*\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.363985825-04:00","tags":null},"/Bocata-Arepa-Bar":{"title":"Bocata Arepa Bar","content":"\nVenezuelan *restaurant* in [Richmond, VA](Richmond,%20VA.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.322215633-04:00","tags":null},"/Bookcision":{"title":"Bookcision","content":"\nFor pulling [Kindle](Kindle.md) Highlights\nhttps://readwise.io/bookcision\n\n````\njavascript:(function (e){var t=document.createElement(\"script\");t.setAttribute(\"src\",e),t.setAttribute(\"crossorigin\",\"anonymous\"),document.body.appendChild(t)}('//bookcision.readwise.io/dist/bookcision.js'));````\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.546591699-04:00","tags":null},"/Boox-Note-Air-2-Plus":{"title":"Boox Note Air 2 Plus","content":"\nLet's discuss the reading and writing journey that has led me to purchasing a Boox Note Air 2 Plus and what I like and don't like about the device.\n\n## My Use Case\n\nI was looking for a reading, writing and thinking device that I can use at my desk to take notes and to read late at night in the bed (plus take notes).\n\n* I should be able to run [Kindle](Kindle.md), [Reader](Reader.md) and my notebooks\n* Should be distraction free\n  * I'm not tempted to watch [YouTube](YouTube.md). \n  * I'm also not likely to get sucked into [Black Hole Distractions](Black%20Hole%20Distractions.md) where I start researching something in the browser and realize an hour has passed.\n* Should be able to be carried easily\n* Writing\n  * An enhanced alternative to paper\n  * Similar speed to paper\n  * Great writing feel\n  * A thinking/reading device that allows switching between those things seamlessly\n  * Lets me capture tasks and move on\n  * Can be used in the bed without a light\n\n### Pros\n\n* A bigger space to read than the [Kindle](Kindle.md)\n* A great writing experience\n  * Very good. Has that analog scratch, it's not quite as viceral as my Baron Fig Confidant with the Ohto Flash Dry, but it definitely gives that sensation\n  * More importantly, I can write notes on it from the bed without getting up.\n* Size and weight it great. It's very very thin and I can hold it in one hand with no problems. I find it much easier to hold in one hand than my iPad Pro 11in.\n* Can run most *Android* apps\n* Backlight is good and supports warm light. It works really well also if you have overhead lighting in your office and the light on your desk isn't perfect. The sensation of backlit paper is pretty cool I must say. *(By default it doesn't come back on when you wake the device from sleep which seems like a weird default, but it's easily fixed in the preferences.)*\n* Great support for Left-handed people\n* Turned off all notifications and it has been distraction free.\n* Notes can be fullscreen and UI free if you have a pen with an eraser button, without an eraser button I found myself needing to go into the UI for that all of the time. \n* Feels faster than the [Kindle Oasis](Kindle.md), especially when typing\n* The built into handwriting to type is surprisingly good. I very rarely use the onscreen keyboard\n* If you export your notes they are vector and are nice and sharp no concerns there. \n\n### Cons\n\n* Expensive at $509 USD\n* App Optimizations out of the box are hit or miss\n  * Initially when I got the device I didn't think it was going to work because the legibility in the Kindle app was very bad. It looked like when you send a low PPI image to a typesetter with anti-aliasing turned off. Later I learned I can turn the optimization off and it looks close to the same quality as my Kindle Oasis, but significantly bigger\n* I wish it came out of the box in a more opinionated fashion. You can get it to be exactly what you want, but you might have to flip a few setting switches. It just seems silly because they took the time to give you all the right options, just didn't turn them on by default. \n* The Kindle app is not quite as sharp as my Kindle Oasis, but it's close enough\n* They should have made the side of the device that the pen sits on flat so that the pen stays put. Both the Boox Pen and the S-Pen don't stay put. \n* Page turning in the notes app could be faster. \n* The UI takes some getting used to, but after a week of use I feel like I can get around really well.\n* I wish I could double tap to undo like I did in *GoodNotes*. Instead I use the eraser.\n\n*If you are considering purchasing this item, please use my [link](https://amzn.to/3OMyzXD) as it helps support this site.* \n\n*This post contains affiliate links.

I didn't want to leave subscribers on the table by not reminding, but I think I've found the upper limit before it feels like too many.\n\n### *2022-06-09*\n\n* Use dynamic zoom in your long clips to keep them from feeling stagnant. This trick is like magic.\n\n### *2022-06-10*\n\n* Use F5.0 when doing top down desk videos. Perhaps a bit shallower for better grain control. If shooting something flat (which you probably are) it may be a good idea to set the focus to manual. (Just remember to set it back when you are done)\n* Do a rough cut of your video after doing the dialog script. Then go in a watch it back while putting in Markers of all the clips you need. Then use that Marker list as your shotlist for your [B-Roll](B-Roll.md)\n\n### *2022-05-27*\n\n* Record your [B-Roll](B-Roll.md) on a *Retina Display* via *Quicktime* to have additional quality for supporting zooming on. \n* The [Akiflow Review](blog/Akiflow%20Review.md) is the best video I have done to date, but it took way too long to author\n  * Script writing process took a bit and could have been done in fewer iterations\n  * I tried using the cut module in [Davinci Resolve](Davinci%20Resolve.md) and it wasn't faster than my existing workflow\n  * I should lock my other timelines when I'm not editing them so that the slice doesn't affect them.\n\n### *2022-03-23*\n\n* Write a paper script for each video, especially if you already have an article written. It's so much easier to figure this out when the camera is not rolling. Pretend that you actually have a crew coming in to do the video and that you would be wasting their time if you didn't know what the video was by then.\n\n### *2022-01-28*\n\n* The end card for a video can only be 20 seconds. I should adjust my outro to be 20 seconds.\n\n### *2022-01-16*\n\n* Make sure the desk is low enough that my head fills most of the frame. This will make looking into the camera significantly easier.\n* Try setting the microphone down low and facing upward as that seems to have few background reverberations than having the microphone high and facing down toward a hard surface like the desk\n* I also moved the microphone arm to get it further from my elbows.\n* With the Camlink I can record everything live and that makes things much simpler in editing. I can focus on the content instead of the editing.\n* I was able to record two videos back to back today due to the simplicity and not having the change camera setups for the content vs the intro/outro.\n* Record from Desk height #2 to have better framing and less bumps from supporting yourself on the desk.\n\n### Video #7\n\n* Don't use a Content timeline as it makes it impossible to use markers\n* You can use a talking head layer above the screenshare+head circle layer to make it easy to do those cuts without a separate timeline\n* You can generate chapters with the markers baked into Davinci Resolve. I should try that next time\n\n### How to Setup the Loom Style Circle\n\n* Add an ellipse in Fusion and load the stored settings\n* Once back in the Editor set the Zoom to 0.250\n* Set the X Position to -1556 (1650 if you want it docked to the right)\n* Set the Y Position to -767 (for bottom)\n* Crop Right to 58.6 (may not be necessary)\n\n### Video #6\n\n* Check your teeth before starting the recording.\n* Make sure the ZV-E10 is not plugged into the computer when recording. The audio will be shit and you'll have to use the screen recording audio.\n\n### Video #3\n\n* How to do Audio Ducking\n* How to properly normalize audio with compression in Audition\n* That Multicam support exists in DaVinci\n* Be careful when shift backspacing to not overwrite things\n* How to do a bottom third headcam\n\n### Video #2\n\n* Set all computers to have Caffeine while recording\n\n* Having to wake the script computer slowed me down\n* Having the Host computer and monitor go to sleep left my microphone without power and led to me having to re-record the last bit of audio for the video\n* Remember to Record a Still for the Thumbnail\n\n\n\n\n### Video #1\n\n* Find some way to record audio on the screensharing computer\n* Do a clap to help with aligning the screenshare and video\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.757734447-04:00","tags":null},"/Levels-of-Specificity":{"title":"Levels of Specificity","content":"\n![Pasted image 20220619100236.png](files/Pasted%20image%2020220619100236.png)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.629662404-04:00","tags":null},"/Life-Mix":{"title":"Life Mix","content":"\n![Pasted image 20220619100211.png](files/Pasted%20image%2020220619100211.png)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.887097232-04:00","tags":null},"/Lifecycle-of-a-Bug":{"title":"Lifecycle of a Bug","content":"\n1.

I grew up in a very small town and we only had dial up internet, but I had an excellent communications teacher, Tracy Wainwright who taught English, Yearbook, Advanced Comm (Morning News) and Newspaper. I wasn't a fan of English, but I loved Yearbook and Advanced Comm. It was in her Yearbook class that I began using Adobe *Photoshop*, *InDesign* \u0026 *Illustrator*. \n* I got pretty decent in those and started creating my own form of awful high school digital art and told my Mom and I wanted to go to art school. She talked me out if it and convinced me to go to business school for *Marketing*. Effectively the same field but from the opposite end of the table. \n* While in college I worked in a local print shop and that was where I actually got good with the Adobe suite. One of our largest customers at the print shop was Virginia Women's Center, the main OBGYN group in Richmond. They would constantly order business cards and all of the cards followed a standard template. \n* The marketing lead would send us the information for the business card and we would update the business card and send them a proof. They would approve it and then we would print it. \n* I found myself spending so much time just doing this process, so I decided I would see if I could automate this. This was my path to engineering. \n* I wrote a web application where they could add their employee roster and the information for the business card and a script in InDesign that could talk to that API ingest that information to XML and apply that XML to the template. \n* Fast forward a few years. I finish my *MBA*...\n* After finishing my Master's program, I moved from Richmond, VA to DC to be involved in the startup scene. I was involved in a startup at the 1776 Incubator in DC. That's how I met David Fairbrothers, [Dorsata](Dorsata.md) CEO. One evening when my first startup was coming to a close I had David show me what he and Greg Herrington were planning for [Dorsata](Dorsata.md). \n* We saw all of these exciting apps being built for consumer use cases, but healthcare was not part of this. Why could we have these highly polished workflows for posting what we ate for dinner, but Doctors are forced to use what is essentially a Microsoft Access Database for managing the care of 1000's of people. It just seemed so backwards. The opportunity to make an impact here was to just so high.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.469694508-04:00","tags":null},"/My-Morning-Routine":{"title":"My Morning Routine","content":"\n* At the start of the day we grab *coffee* and do [Morning Pages](sources/Morning%20Pages.md)\n  * It doesn't have to be at the desk if we don't want to.\n  * We will avoid:\n    * *Twitter*\n    * *Feedly*\n    * *Reddit*\n    * [Wordle](Wordle.md)\n  * Those are reserved for later on the day when our brain needs a break from the non-stop work.\n\n## Relates to:\n\n[Most productive time of the day](seedlings/There%20is%20a%20two%20hour%20window%20in%20each%20day%20where%20you%20are%20most%20productive..md)\n[Time Traps](Time%20Sinks.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.836490569-04:00","tags":null},"/My-Phone-is-Ruining-My-Creativity":{"title":"My Phone is Ruining My Creativity","content":"\nAuthor: *Eric Floberg* \nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecx8u4inJHM\n\n[Boredom breeds creativity](Boredom%20breeds%20creativity.md)\n\nTherefore, avoiding being bored is the death of creativity.\n\n## Basic steps you can try:\n\n* [Don't check your phone for the first hour you wake](Don't%20check%20your%20phone%20for%20the%20first%20hour%20you%20wake.md)\n* Don't check your phone while moving\n* Don't check your phone on the toilet\n* Don't check your phone the hour before bed\n\n[Time Traps](Time%20Sinks.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.364096205-04:00","tags":null},"/My-favorite-digital-workflow-apps":{"title":"My favorite digital workflow apps","content":"\n\n \u003e \n \u003e I'm a digital workflow nerd.

Record in a small, quiet room\n\nRecord in the smallest and quietest room possible to reduce outside noise and echoes. Shut windows and doors, turn off noise-making machines or devices, and put pets out of the room. Fill your recording space with soft items (couches, pillows, carpet, etc.) to muffle any errant noises. \n\n2. Keep your body still\n\nMoving your body around creates background noise while recording. This happens a lot if you use earbud headphones. The wire lays close to your chest which causes the microphone to rub against your shirt and collar. Try to stay still in your chair with your feet planted. Avoid moving things around on your desk.\n\n#### Speech\n\n3. Be yourself\n\nYou’re here because we already know you’re a great human and speaker! Don’t worry about “likes” or “ums.” Using filler language like “uhhhh” or “y’know?” is a sign that you’re speaking casually. Try not to keep track of your “like” count.\n\n4. Signal Non-verbally\n\nIn a regular conversation, we can see smiles, frowns, fidgets, and more. That’s hard to do in a podcast! Smiling makes you sound friendly. Vary your vocal inflection. If you are trying to convey a particular emotion — genuine interest! shock! delight! — it really helps.\n\n5. Don’t be afraid to re-do\n\nIf you feel you were unclear, misspoke, or would just like a re-do, you can always say “let me try that again”. You can also always flag it audibly for our editor “Hey Editor, please don’t include that!” either after you’ve said it, or the end of the recording. Your privacy matters.\n\n#### Style\n\n6. Stay aware of time  \n   Given that Moss \u0026 Friends is a 30 minute podcast, consider which stories should take priority, and keep the rest concise.\n\n6. Have fun  \n   Moss and Friends is ultimately a few friends having a chat about the things we care about: healthcare, wellness, and design. It’s okay to make jokes, laugh, and speak as you would in any conversation with your friends.\\*\\*\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.594172398-04:00","tags":null},"/Poka-Yoke":{"title":"Poka-Yoke","content":"\n*Seth Godin*\n\nMistake proofing, or its Japanese equivalent poka-yoke (pronounced PO-ka yo-KAY), is the use of **any automatic device or method that either makes it impossible for an error to occur** or makes the error immediately obvious once it has occurred.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.683624922-04:00","tags":null},"/Pokemon":{"title":"Pokemon","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.272317403-04:00","tags":null},"/Polymath":{"title":"Polymath","content":"\nA polymath is **a person who knows a lot about a lot of subjects**.

I've tested the [Boox Note Air 2 Plus](Boox%20Note%20Air%202%20Plus.md), the [blog/reMarkable 2](blog/reMarkable%202.md) and now the SuperNote A5 X. In this article I will tell you about the SuperNote A5 X, how it stacks up against the competitors and who is and isn't a good fit for this device. \n\nI should start by saying that *Ratta* did send this out to me per my request, but that has no influence on my review and they asked that I share my honest opinion, even the things I didn't like. \n\n## Initial Impressions and Build Quality\n\n* Durability shouldn't be an issue. The fact that it is plastic and flexible means I'm not worried about it. The [Boox](Boox%20Note%20Air%202%20Plus.md) and the [blog/reMarkable 2](blog/reMarkable%202.md) I feel like I need to bring a sleeve in order to not be afraid of breaking them. If I was on the go a ton, this would be my preferred tablet to carry.\n* The Supernote is nearly twice as thick as the reMarkable. About the thickness of a single subject notebook, which as a lefty are not particularly fond memories of writing on real paper.\n* I wish the screen were brighter. The fact that it is missing a backlight is one thing, but combined with a low whitepoint screen makes it feel even darker.\n* The Heart of Metal pen is great. It has great feel and weight. Its the perfect thickness for me. Feels very premium. The lack of eraser is no big deal on the Supernote because of the two finger erase gesture. Every other tablet should add this feature, it is a game changer.\n* I love how thin the folio is. It feels like it protects but doesn't affect the form factor of the device\n* I wish the folio attached to the device in two places. I sometimes accidentally pick up in between the device and the folio.\n* I love that flipping open the folio unlocks the device. It feels snappy and I love it.\n\n## Writing Feel\n\n* I don't love the feel of writing on the screen, but I think that is very much a personal preference thing and that many people will.\n* The screen is very smooth and I find that I prefer the more vellum feel of the Boox and reMarkable\n* I have to not press as hard as I normally would or the pen tip will dig into the screen. It doesn't do any damage it just affects the writing feel. This is probably what a thick pad of paper would do as well. \n* The look of your writing after the fact doesn't look as good as the Boox, but it does have anti-aliasing unlike the reMarkable 2\n* I find that I prefer the ballpoint pen over the fine-liner and its very similar to the reMarkable in that regard. It's interesting, because I do like fineliners in real life, but apparently not digitally.\n* The best nibs for the Boox / reMarkable will not feel like the best nibs for the Supernote. The screens are too different\n\n## Software\n\n* They have the prettiest toolbar of the 3 main eInk tablets. \n* I love that I can move the toolbar to the bottom, this is a huge deal for lefties like me who curl their hands as they write. This allows me to use the tablet without hitting the buttons at the top of the screen. This is an issue I've had with both the Supernote and the reMarkable.\n* I like that you can set it s page turns only occur when using two fingers, but I will say I still encounter accidental page flips from my palm.\n* The icons and tools are so intuitive, I love that I get one of each tool at the root of the toolbar. It has the right tools so I don't even feel the need to customize it.\n* I love the new header with the title and page number. It's obvious to me what notebook I'm in, while also not distracting me from my notes.\n* I love that the tool state is shared across documents. It means I can create a fresh document and not waste a bunch of time setting my pen settings.\n\n* In just the 6 weeks I've had the SuperNote A5 X the software has improved significantly. I was able to join Ratta's beta program and got a version of the software that worked much better for me as a lefty. That Beta patch that I was running has since been made public. \n\n## Organization / Navigation\n\n* Being able to pin pages and documents to the quick access menu is awesome.\n* The star feature and titles are really awesome and allow you to have long lived documents like notebooks but still be able to find things.\n* The fact that new notes are autonamed with today's date is a nice touch. Way to go Supernote.\n* Page flips are incredibly fast and make the Boox note experience feel slow.\n* The reMarkable 2 can get close to the navigation quality of the Supernote with hacks, but if you are not going to take the time to hack it then the Supernote is far superior.\n\n## Wish List\n\n* I wish you could set the thickness of the highlighter similar to how you can with the other pens? I have a consistent line-height that I write with and would be useful to be able to set the highlight to that line-height.\n\n* I wish you could switch tools with a gesture like in DDVK's hack on the reMarkable. This would enable me to run the tablet without any GUI and still be able to easily switch between the pen and the highlighter.\n* I wish the export was actually vector based instead of being a live trace of a raster image (or at least that is what it appears like).\n* I wish I could export documents to *Google Drive*\n* I wish the PDF highlighter worked more like the one on the reMarkable their highlighter is awesome.\n* I wish I can check or uncheck whether I want the template/grid when exporting.\n* I wish I could send tasks to *Todoist*, like I do on the Boox device. I manage one central task inbox and I wish this could feed into it. \n\n## Who is this tablet good for? (Who should buy this)\n\n* The person who carries a daily journal / planner. This is the eInk device that feels the most like writing on a pad of paper or journal. People who maintain paper todo lists / day plans will also love this device.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:29.07957506-04:00","tags":null},"/SurfingKeys":{"title":"SurfingKeys","content":"\nTried out on *2022-04-29*, but it seemed too complicated and not a big enough upgrade over [Vimium](Vimium.md) to warrant relearning a bunch of muscle memory.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.758067462-04:00","tags":null},"/Suzuki-Method":{"title":"Suzuki Method","content":"\n### Strategy for teaching / learning *Piano*\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.558047851-04:00","tags":null},"/Swift-Development":{"title":"Swift Development","content":"\n\n \u003e \n \u003e Let me start by saying, I am not a Swift developer.

I think part of why I love it is that I've learned enough tricks along the way that I have for the most part gotten my computer out of the way of my thought process. \\[It's basically an extension of me at this point.\\] I want other people to enjoy the time they spend with their devices as much as I do. That's why I created a Youtube Channel where I chronicle my workflow experiments. What worked, what didn't and the tricks I've learned along the way\"\n\n### Why Me?\n\n* I've always been someone who was good with computers\n* I'm an engineer who knows deeply how computers function and can translate that understanding into easily understandable concepts\n* I've worked from home for the past 8 years and it has been incredibly rewarding for me, put my learnings from the past 8 years to use in your life.\n* I'm constantly experimenting and trying new things and keeping what works. Try out what I have been refining over the last 10+ years and see if it works for you.\n* I literally use a computer or iDevice most waking hours of my life. If it is good enough for me, it is likely good enough for you.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.671984497-04:00","tags":null},"/YouTube-Funnel":{"title":"YouTube Funnel","content":"\nI can't say that I fully understand this yet, but this is something I'm starting to contemplate\n![Personal Notes_9.png](files/Personal%20Notes_9.png)![Personal Notes_10.png](files/Personal%20Notes_10.png)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.634036133-04:00","tags":null},"/YouTube-Script-Writing":{"title":"YouTube Script Writing","content":"\n[YouTube](YouTube.md)\n\n![Pasted image 20220619100532.png](files/Pasted%20image%2020220619100532.png)\n![Pasted image 20220619100536.png](files/Pasted%20image%2020220619100536.png)\n![Pasted image 20220619100542.png](files/Pasted%20image%2020220619100542.png)\n![Pasted image 20220619100547.png](files/Pasted%20image%2020220619100547.png)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.645327506-04:00","tags":null},"/YouTube-Shorts":{"title":"YouTube Shorts","content":"\n[YouTube](YouTube.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:29.132551141-04:00","tags":null},"/YouTube-Titles-and-Thumbnails":{"title":"YouTube Titles and Thumbnails","content":"\n* [YouTube](YouTube.md) is more likely to recommend videos with titles under 55 characters because they are less likely to get cut off.\n\n*People desire room for creativity*\nInstead of titling a video: \"Best way X on Y\" \nTry: \"How I X on Y\"\n\nThis way you're giving them a good starting point but they feel like they can tweak / innovate on it.

It basically became my inbox for everything: Tasks, Ideas, Funny things that people said that I didn't want to instantly forget. I came to the realization that as long as I could get the item into TickTick I would act on it. \n\nThe issue I found was although TickTick has good quick capture and dictation built in, there was no way they could do it fast enough for what I wanted. Mostly because of limitations in iOS. At least on my iPhone XS it can only boot so fast and it only can be ready for input so fast. \n\nSo I set out to see if I could create a quick capture that was instantly ready for input and that I could easily dictate to while in the shower or driving in the car. \n\nHere's where I landed:\n\n* Tap Quick Capture: to type in a quick task\n* I could tap the same for Dictate\n* If I'm in another app and realize there's something I need to do late I can double tap the back of my phone to open the quick capture.\n* Lastly if I'm in driving in the car or get an idea while in the shower I can say Hey Siri, Jot\n\nAlright so let me show you how to set this up:\nQuick Capture \n\nThe Dictation Workflow \n\n* New Shortcut\n* Choose a New: In this case Jot this Down\n* Choose Add Action\n  * Search for Dictate Text\n* Search for TickTick\n  * Choose Add Single Task and Choose Dictated Text\n  * Spin open the Options Arrow and be sure to Enable Edit in App. An interesting issue with Shortcut workflows is they don't open the app and the apps don't get a chance to send your newly created item to the cloud which means your newly created item only exists on your device which is exactly what we don't want. If you choose Edit in App then TickTick will open and your item will be available anywhere you access TickTick.\n  * From here you can hit the share button at the bottom and choose Add to Home Screen\n    * You can change the icon by tapping here on the left and you can change the App name here on the right. Choose add and you've got a Quick Capture App you can launch from the Home Screen\n\nAlright on to the Quick Capture Workflow:\n\n* Same initial steps as before \n  * New Shortcut\n  * Name it \n  * Choose Add Action\n    * Search for TickTick\n    * Add a Single Task\n      * Tap where it says task and choose Ask Each Time. Press Done on your keyboard\n      * Spin open the arrow and enable edit in App\n    * Lets give it a spin.\n    * If it asks would you like to Allow Your shortcut to share data with TickTick then choose Allow\n    * To make it launch on Double tapping the back of your phone:\n      * Go to settings -\u003e Accessibility -\u003e Touch -\u003e Back Tap -\u003e. Double Tap  and choose your Shortcut from the bottom of the list.\n      * Now Double tapping the back of your iPhone will launch your quick capture shortcut.\n\n* There you have it. That's how I quick capture and dictate with TickTick for iOS. If this was helpful to you please leave a like and comment. Also I have a video on how I use Alfred to Quick launch anything.

As a creative (or anyone who likes to solve tough problems), *flow state* is where you make progress. I sometimes call this *Progress Time*. Everything else you do is to keep the lights on, and to improve the chances that you find yourself in flow state.\n\n## Factors effecting flow state:\n\n* getting good sleep the night before\n* have my to-dos for the day in order so that they aren't nagging at me\n* know that I have a block of time allotted where I'm not going to accidentally miss my next meeting\n* Coffee (not too much)\n* Noise cancelling headphones (even if nothing is playing), there is something about separating myself from my surroundings that is especially helpful.\n  * The [AirPods Pro](../AirPods%20Pro.md) are amazing for this because they are lightweight, non-fatiguing and have no cable to get wrapped up in.\n\n## My Setup\n\nFor me, the most reliable way to achieve *flow state* is to throw in the [AirPods Pro](https://amzn.to/3yJY1HU) headphones and set them to *Noise Cancellation* and turn on one of the following:\n\n* [Journaling (No Lyrics) on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Vy94FDF0S5A4FTvKnTWtL?si=279657fa9f034359)\n* [Calm Vibes on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX1s9knjP51Oa?si=bdbae497376f4858)\n* [SKRILLEX LIVE @ ULTRA MUSIC FESTIVAL 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2VmcuOEqEg)\n\nI have much higher quality headphones than the Airpods, but some combination of the noise cancellation, weightlessness, and the lack of a cable makes a huge difference in helping me focus on what I need to get done. I do find it odd that I can either listen to calm, quiet music or aggressive dubstep and they both enable the same thing, but they do. I find listening to unfamiliar music with forward lyrics difficult for *concentration*. The noise cancellation is also helpful because I find the constant fan noise of the [Touchbar Macbook Pro](../Touchbar%20Macbook%20Pro.md) especially annoying. \n\nFor listening to music for enjoyment, I prefer the [Hifiman Sundara](https://amzn.to/3P22hYr) headphones. \n*Use music without lyrics to help achieve flow state*\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.563066661-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Heirloom-Grade":{"title":"Heirloom Grade","content":"\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \"When you buy something cheap and bad, the best you’re going to feel about it is when you buy it.

You start from scratch, there are 1000's of plugins to chose from, and honestly it all becomes one big distraction from actually generating thoughts and ideas. In this video, I will share my approach to managing an Obisidian vault in hopes it will save you a few headaches when starting from scratch. \n\n**Note:** I publish my Obsidian Vault using Github Pages and because of this I use more folders than most vaults you will see. Having folders that I can hide away makes making sure I only share what I intend to share with the Internet. If you haven't already go check out my vault at brandonkboswell.com. I will put a link in the description.\n\n## Folders / Major Areas\n\n* 1-1\n  * *I thoroughly enjoy writing in Obsidian, so I put my 1-1 notes with people I chat with on a regular basis instead of putting them in another app*\n  * It's just a running log with a date and the todos associated with that session\n* Business\n  * A random assortment of notes that I want to keep and link to, but I don't want shared with the world.\n* Collections\n  * Where I collect items I thought were interesting that I want to be able to refer back to, but I might not actually have significant commentary on. Please let me know how you do this in the comments, that way I do this is not ideal. Basically I screenshot or get the URL for whatever it is and then Quick Add to TickTick and then when I clean out my [TickTick](../TickTick.md) Inbox I put it into [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) for storage.\n* Cooking\n  * My wife is a far better cook then I, but I do cook a few meals each week. The issue I always found was I would do a meal and then by the time I cook that meal the next time I couldn't remember what I had tried, so I end up making the same mistakes and not progressing at perfecting the dish. So I started creating cooking notes for these and after each time I cook a dish I put another entry into that note. When I go to start cooking that dish again I refer back to what I had written the last time on what to try next. \n* Ideas\n  * A random assortment of ideas. These are mostly a folder just to make them private when publishing\n* People\n  * My notes on people. This one is also private as it has a bunch of people who didn't ask to be published online.\n* Personal\n  * Pictures of cards, notes people have sent me or deeply personal writing prompts that don't need to be public\n* Projects\n  * A folder where all of the Youtube Videos or Articles start while I'm figuring them out. Currently this folder is not published, but I might make it public soon and then just apply a draft tag to things that shouldn't be published. For instance the script for this video is in there\n* Seedlings\n  * This is where all of my *Atomic Notes* / *Evergreen Notes* go. \n* Sources\n  * This is where all of my Readwise Highlights \u0026 Literary Notes go.\n* Temporal\n  * Daily Notes\n    * Ex: 2022-02-25\n  * Weekly Notes\n    * Ex: 2022-W07\n  * Annual Notes\n    * Ex: [2021 In Review](../2021%20In%20Review.md)\n* To Publish\n  * Articles / Documents that would be useful to the public, but need cleanup / refinement before they can be shared\n* Underscore Gang — I need to find a way to describe this\n  * Index\n  * Content Calendar\n  * Backlogs\n    * Gaming Backlog\n    * Idea Backlog\n    * Book Backlog\n    * Music Backlog\n    * TV Backlog\n  * Seedings\n  * Writing Prompts\n\n## Plugins I use\n\n* See Video where I run through this.\n\n## Themes\n\n* I use the Minimal Theme\n* I've tried the Notational one and the California Coast and they are both good as well, I just happen to like the Minimal Theme slightly more. \n\n[Obsidian](../Obsidian.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.55586661-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/How-I-keep-my-Chrome-Tabs-under-control-with-Merge-All-Windows-Chrome-Extension":{"title":"How I keep my Chrome Tabs under control with \"Merge All Windows\" Chrome Extension","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.28083448-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/How-I-use-TickTick-2021":{"title":"How I use TickTick 2021","content":"\n\n \u003e \n \u003e Don’t play “catch and release” with your thoughts.

By making it a habit to “capture” and save them, you can allow them to live forever in a trusted system that reflects your goals and interests. This also leaves your mind free and clear to come up with even more ideas. \n\n## — Thiago Forte\n\n---\n\n### Quick Capture\n\nI get ideas \u0026 inspiration often while working on others and TickTick's quick capture allows me to quickly jot that down and get back to what I was doing without missing a beat.\n\\* From iOS\n\\* From MacOS\n\\* From Chrome\n\n### The Inbox\n\nMy digital note list. This is where I cull through all the things \u0026 set follow up timing and lists for. \n\nReference Seth Godin's work around a system over outcomes. You have control over showing up, you have less control over the outcome, but if you create a system where you produce consistently and are constantly working on improving, you will be doing what you can.\n\n### My Lists\n\n* What are they:\n  * Strategic Work vs Junk Work\n  * Routines\n  * Home\n  * Evening\n  * Personal Development\n  * Youtube\n    * Youtube Channel\n    * Youtube Video Ideas\n  * Productivity Blog\n  * Reviews\n  * Family\n  * Store\n  * Content Backlog\n  * Ideas\n\n### Routines\n\nPrior to embracing a digital todo list, I was a very reactionary person. Things didn't get done until I noticed they were needed. For example in my twenties I wouldn't go and get a haircut until I realized that my hair was way too long. In my mid twenties I finally realized the value of pre-scheduling haircuts and how I didn't have to look like a bum between haircuts. \nOnce I figured this out I could apply this same pattern to other things in life. Cutting the dog's nails, changing air filters in the house, getting the car inspected, etc.\nSetting up repeats when creating routines. \n\n### Calendar View / Time Blocking\n\n* How I do my timeblocking and make sure that my plan for the day makes sense. In a perfect world I would review this each night in preparation for the next day, but I typically review this with my morning cup of coffee before work. \n* Time blocking, including thinking time. Articles. Anything I want to get done. There is a much greater chance that you will follow through on your thinking time if you put it on a calendar. I used to do this in Fantastical, but I found that if I had to move that time for whatever reason (it happened a lot) that I would get phantom notifications and it quickly got the point that I was hating *Fantastical*. I worked with their support team, but ultimately it sounds like a limitation in how their push notification implementation with iOS and it wasn't fixable. So I solved this by moving my [Timeblocking](../Timeblocking.md) to TickTick as it could represent my Google Calendars similarly to Fantastical. (It does have a less than desirable quirk where declined meetings will continue to show). TickTick I've reported this (please fix it).\n\n---\n\n### Pros\n\n* Has Calendar Support that Things 3 was (intentionally) missing which made timeboxing and aligning with meeting schedules challenging\n* Really good support for attachments \n  (this was legitimately the thing that made me leave Things 3)\n* Syncing between multiple devices\n  * Native + Web\n* Excellent Quick Capture\n* Foldered Lists are pretty useful\n* Free Tier will likely work for many people\n\n---\n\n### Cons\n\n* Template support exists, but is a bit clunky\n* Invites you decline still show up in TickTick. This is especially painful for weekly recurring meetings. (Fix this TickTick)\n* You can't move calendar events the way you can tasks, so you still need to use another calendar app such as Fantastical or Google Cal\n* Calendar view is more readable in the Browser than on the Mac App\n  * The difference used to be huge, now it's just minor.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.296647951-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Launch-anything-on-your-Mac-with-Alfred":{"title":"Launch anything on your Mac with Alfred","content":"\nI started using Alfred back in 2014 and It's been a critical part of my Mac OS workflow ever since. I'm not going to get into everything that's magical about Alfred because I could ramble way too long about that. Today let's focus on one particular trick for Alfred which is Bookmarks. \n\nI use [Alfred](../Alfred.md) to open Applications all of the time by tapping Option + Space and typing the application I am looking for, but more and more often the applications I use each day are in my web browser, especially the ones that I work on and have to administer. \nOften times there are unique URLs for pages I use, but maybe only once or twice a month. \n\nWherever possible I want to remove looking from things from my workflow and instead I want to be able to find and launch those things as quickly as I can think of them.

If you add a new bookmark just hit Option + Space to open Alfred and then press escape and by the time you open it the next time your newly added bookmark will be there. \n\nEver since I learned this trick, I feel like I can now get to all the places on my Mac that I want as soon as I think of them.

Along the way, I will show you 5 tips to have a healthy balance with your phone\n\nMany videos talk about decluttering your phone, and I am in favor of this, but ultimately for a different reason. Everything in your life is vying for your attention, and your phone likely most of all. A big point of emphasis with my iPhone is making it as much of a distraction free tool as it can be. For that reason, aside from the dock, my Home Screen only has 6 apps on it. \n\nShow's the *iPhone* on Screen w/ the Dock illuminated. There's nothing too crazy on the dock\n\n## 1. Out of sight, out of mind — Intentionality\n\nI am a big proponent of out of sight, out of mind. My goal is to have intention when I pick up my *iPhone*. I don't uninstall distracting apps from my phone, I just make it where my brain has to have intention to open that app. If I want to open Reddit, I'm going to search for it. I introduce just that little bit of friction so that I won't get pulled into an addictive open just because I unlocked my phone. \n\n## 2. Add a little friction\n\nFor some apps, hiding the icon on your home screen may not be enough, the ones I have to watch out for are *Twitter* and *Reddit*. For those apps, you might want to check out [One Sec](../One%20Sec.md). It's an app you install on your iPhone and with a little setup it will add a little friction to opening those apps that you can't quite seem to get away from. It gives you a moment to pause and think, does this app align with my goals? The other feature that [One Sec](../One%20Sec.md) has, is the ability to send you a notification if you are still in the app after a certain period of time. So if you are still using the app after say 5 minutes, it will give you a notification in hopes that it will pull you out of the Matrix. [You can get 15% off One Sec by using this link](https://apps.apple.com/redeem/?ctx=offercodes\u0026id=1532875441\u0026code=BRANDON15). Alternatively, you can use *iOS Shortcuts* to set a 5-minute timer when you open those addictive apps. That is why I have a clock on my home screen so that I can cancel that timer when I leave. If you're curious about how you can set up this shortcut for yourself, let me know down in the comments and I can put up a video on how to do that.\n\n## 3. Give yourself more rewarding distractions\n\nWe can't be distraction free all the time, and for that I put some good distractions at arms reach, if I just need a break from what I'm doing. For me, this is [Readwise](../Readwise.md) and their new RSS+Read-it-later app [Reader](../Reader.md). So if I just need a break instead of getting pulled into the infinity pool which is Twitter, I can review some key highlights from books or articles I've read, or read an article I have saved for later. It is like putting healthy snacks out in case you get hungry. \n\n## 4. Turn off notifications\n\nI shouldn't have to say this, but for those 9 people out there who still have notifications enabled on their iPhone, please go turn them off. This is the equivalent of signing yourself up for spam phone calls in the modern age. The only real exception I have to this rule is my car and my front doorbell. Aside from that, my notifications are off. While we're on the topic of notifications, I highly recommend that you enable iOS's new * Focus Mode* feature. It lets you filter out messages, phone calls and notifications so that you only get important ones while enabled. I have this set up to turn on automatically at 9am when I start my workday. It then runs until noon, turns off for an hour for lunch and then comes back from 1pm to 5pm. \n\n## 5. Avoid using your phone during high productivity periods\n\nFor me, that's in the morning before work. I have an hour or so that I can do something meaningful with before the workday starts, but if I reach for my iPhone that hour is likely gone. For that reason, I no longer us my iPhone as an alarm clock. I recently bought the [Loftie](../Loftie.md) alarm clock and it has given me my mornings back by not having my iPhone be the first thing I'm greeted with in the morning. It allows you to avoid the news and twitter and set the tone you want for your day. \n\n## 6. Make your phone less desirable at rest\n\nThis goes back to the your phone is a magnet for your attention. If you put a picture of your partner or your child on lock screen of your phone you are just pulling yourself back into. Its going to suck you back in and drain your willpower. For me I set my background to a black image. That does two things, it makes it less likely I'm going to get pulled in and it saves me some battery. As long as you have an iPhone with an *OLED* screen you save battery by having a black background image because the pixels only have to illuminate when there is color to display. The other thing you can do is set you phone to be grayscale so that the bright colors don't pull you in. It's pretty impractical to leave it in grayscale all of the time, so I have an accessibility shortcut set up where I triple tap the lock button to toggle between grayscale and color. This lets me see the colors of a photo I just took, but not have the home screen be colored while at rest.\n\n## 7. Make the iPhone a great capture tool\n\nI'm trying out this new app *Quick Capture*. Quick gives you a quick way to jot down a quick note either by hand, photo or verbally. Think of it like *Drafts*, but it supports dictation.\n\n* Often times when I'm trying to quick capture something I want it to go into my task manager. In my case, [Akiflow](../Akiflow.md). Show the double tap to write things and triple tap to dictate.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.350854014-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz":{"title":"Publishing your Obsidian Vault Online with Quartz","content":"\n\n \u003e \n \u003e NOTE: The easiest way to publish your vault online is by using [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). I put a bunch of time into figuring out how all of this would work together, and I probably could have saved a bunch of time by just using Obsidian Publish. Either way, I've learned a ton in setting this up. I also have more control on what does and doesn't get published. I have a ton of private content in my vault and I do not want that being published, which is why I went to all this trouble you're about to see. Yes, I could use multiple vaults, but that seems annoying when you want to link to something that resides in another vault.\n\nSo you're thinking about publishing your [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) Vault online, but you're not sure if you want to pay for *Obsidian Publish* or not. I've been there, that was the exact same situation I was in when I considered publishing my vault. Call me cheap, but I wasn't sure if I was ready to pay $20 a month for the rest of time. Would I keep writing meaningful content, would people actually ready it? So instead, I decided I was going to figure out a way to publish my vault without the monthly fee. I now publish my vault online, and I don't pay anything for hosting. **(You are currently reading this article from the digital vault that I publish through this method)**\n\n* For me, I cobbled together a combination of:\n  * [**Quartz**](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n    * A nice, clean-looking template for your digital garden that sits on top of *Hugo*. Once you get your bearings with it, you will find that it is just a *Hugo* site and you can customize it a ton if you would like.\n  * **[Obsidian Export](https://github.com/brandonkboswell/obsidian-export/tree/title_frontmatter)** (Slightly Modified)\n    * A Rust based library for converting your Obsidian Vault to standards compliant *Markdown* that supports translating Obsidian style links to standard links that are compatible with Hugo.\n    * Quartz and Hugo both assume that all of your files have a title attribute in their frontmatter. Unfortunately, most of my files do not have this title front matter. I have a branch of obsidian-export (linked above) that uses the file's name to generate titles when that frontmatter is not present. \n  * **[obsidian-hugo](https://github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian)** \n    * *Quartz* has an easy setup that allows you to commit all of your content to *Github* and it will compile everything via *Github Actions*. This is fantastic and super helpful. The issue is I have private content that I don't want on Github.\n    * So instead I use the *obsidian-hugo* library that Quartz's Github Action uses just I use it on my local machine and precompile the filtered content before uploading to Github. This enables me to host my Digital Garden on Github (for free) without risking private content accidentally leaking out onto the internet.\n  * [**Github Pages**](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)\n    * This is where I publish the content that gets output. It's all static html and is being served by Github. There is no amount of traffic I could ever manage to generate that Github couldn't handle.\n\n### Why do I use Obsidian Export when Obsidian Hugo is required by Quartz and does most of the same things?\n\n* **obsidian-export** does a very good job of filtering out files and folders you don't want exported\n* it makes me confident that there is no chance that private data gets uploaded by not even allowing that data to be in the folder that gets parsed\n* It handles bad or no frontmatter so that the downstream pipeline doesn't have any issues\n* You can avoid a bunch of hacks to Quartz (and your layout files) by ensuring that your files have title attributes in their frontmatter. I have hacked together a fork of obsidian-export that does this automatically based on the file name when exporting. https://github.com/brandonkboswell/obsidian-export/tree/title_frontmatter\n\n# High Level Steps (these are from memory as I set this up a few months ago)\n\n1. Clone [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) into a local directory\n1. Create a Repo on Github to host your public garden\n   1. [Getting started with Github Pages](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-personal-website-with-github-pages-and-hugo-6c68592204c7)\n   1. [Configuring a Custom Domain for your Github Pages Site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)\n1. Make the public folder of your Quartz repo a submodule of that repo \n   1. `git submodule add \u003cyour_github_project_url\u003e ./public`\n1. Install Hugo for minifying and running a local server\n   1. `brew install hugo`\n1. Clone obsidian-export wherever you keep libraries\n   1. Obsidian Export runs in *Rust*, so make sure you have Rust enabled on your machine\n   1. If I remember correctly, I ran `cargo build` from the obsidian-export directory to build a local binary that can be called in the compile script\n1. Clone obsidian-hugo wherever you keep libraries\n   1. Obsidian-hugo runs in *Go*, so make sure you have Go enabled on your machine and in your PATH;\n   1. The watch/compile script will run `go run ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian -input=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/content -output=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/assets/indices -index -root=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz;` when it compiles.\n1. Update the compile and watch scripts for the paths of your folders\n   1. My quartz directory is at: ~/Sites/quartz\n   1. My Obsidian Vault is at (My *iCloud* Folder): ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/bkb\n   1. My hugo-obsidian directory is at: ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian\n1. Configure your configuration files\n   1. **Hugo Config** — quartz/config.toml file\n   1. **Quartz Config** — data/config.yaml \n   1. **Quartz Graph Config** — data/graphConfig.yaml\n1. Add a file name **.export-ignore** to your Obsidian Vault\n   1. Obsidian Export will skip any files / folders you mention here and make sure they don't get handed to Quartz\n   1. You can't create this file in Obsidian (you likely want to use the finder or a Code Editor).\n   1. A sample of my .export-ignore file is further down in this article\n1. Run the watch script (which will do an initial compile and then watch for changes to your Obsidian Vault)\n   1. Note that the compile script empties out your quartz/content directory so that files that may have been moved or deleted from your Obsidian Vault do not end up being pushed to the public internet. **Make sure that this path is set correctly before running the watch or compile script.**\n1. Start a hugo server from your quartz directory\n   1. `./serve.sh`\n1. Assuming everything worked, you should be able to preview your vault at: localhost:1313\n1. Tinker / tweak for way too long\n1. When you're ready you can commit your quartz/public directory to Github pages\n   1. **Verify *(especially for the first commit)* that there is nothing private that you don't want uploaded to the internet.**\n   1. `cd ~/Sites/quartz/public; git add .; git commit -m \"Update\"; git push origin`\n\n---\n\n## Configure your .export-ignore file at the root of your Obsidian Vault. Here's mine:\n\n````\ntemplates/*\nprivate/*\n1-1/*\nbusiness/*\ncollections/*\npeople/*\nto_publish/*\nfiles/*\ntemporal/*\npersonal/*\nscreenshots/*\nideas/*\n.trash/*\n.obsidian/*\n_content_calendar.md\n````\n\n## To compile your notes once\n\n````bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd ~/Sites/quartz; ./compile.sh\n\n--- compile.sh ---\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian; rm -fr ~/Sites/quartz/content/*; rm -rf ~/Sites/quartz/public/*; ~/Sites/obsidian-export/target/debug/obsidian-export --add-titles --frontmatter=always ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/bkb ~/Sites/quartz/content; go run ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian -input=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/content -output=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/assets/indices -index -root=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz; (cd ~/Sites/quartz \u0026\u0026 hugo --minify)\n\n````\n\n## To recompile your notes on change\n\n````bash\ncd ~/Sites/quartz; ./watch.sh\n\n--- watch.sh ---\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go; export GOROOT=\"$(/usr/local/bin/brew --prefix golang)/libexec\"; export PATH=\"$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin:${GOROOT}/bin\"; cd ~/Sites/quartz; nodemon -w ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/bkb -w ~/Sites/quartz/assets/js -w ~/Sites/quartz/assets/styles -w ~/Sites/quartz/layouts -w ~/Sites/quartz/config.toml -w ~/Sites/quartz/data/config.yaml -x \"~/Sites/quartz/compile.sh\" -e md,html,js,scss,xml\n\n````\n\n## To preview your changes before pushing to Github, you can run a local hugo server:\n\nSometimes the server will crash while the compile script is rebuilding everything. If you wrap the hugo server code in a while loop then it will restart itself if this happens. For this I will have two terminal panes open on for the watch script and one for the hugo server. As I make changes to my Obsidian Vault or the Quartz files it will recompile the content and then hugo will recompile, at which point you can refresh your browser to see the change. Usually that will be at localhost:1313.\n\n````bash\n(while true; do \n\thugo server --disableFastRender\ndone) \u0026\n````\n\n## When I'm ready to publish an update to Github:\n\nGo to the garden folder and commit those changes:\n\n````bash\ncd ~/sites/quartz/public; git add .; git commit -m \"Update\"; git push origin\n````\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n* You probably want to do your ignoring of personal files at the obsidian-export level because if a file is referenced in another file, but that file is flagged as a draft in the frontmatter then hugo-obsidian will have trouble with that and make hugo error on compile with the backlinks. Doing your ignoring of specific files in obsidian-export takes care of this.\n* If you've never used *Hugo* before (like I hadn't prior to this project), you may not know that Hugo has a static folder that generates assets you want to be in any subsequent rebuilds. When I first started this project I added a bunch of lines to the compile script to create files and moving files around when all I really needed to do was add those files to my static folder. \n* You are going to want to update your Hugo layout files to take advantage of the backlink rendering provided by Obsidian Export. The changes you'll want to make, plus an explanation are available here: https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export/issues/8#issuecomment-774521792\n\n## Previous Attempts\n\n* Originally I modified hugo-obsidian to get around the no titles issue, since I now do this in obsidian-export I no longer need to maintain a fork of that code. If it's useful to you, here is the change I made: \n  * I had to make a minor modification to obsidian-hugo because it assumes that all of your files have a title attribute in their frontmatter. Unfortunately, most of my files do not have this title front matter. I have a branch of obsidian-hugo that uses the file's name to generate titles if that frontmatter is not present. https://github.com/brandonkboswell/hugo-obsidian/tree/without_titles. \n    *As the time of this writing, that branch has not been merged into the main repo, but it may have by the time you're reading this.*\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.277610623-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Quicklaunch-your-commonly-used-applications-with-Karabiner-Elements":{"title":"Quicklaunch your commonly used applications with  Karabiner Elements","content":"\n## What shortcuts do I use?\n\n* **O Launching**\n  * Originally found it watching a YouTube Video by *Jesse Skelton* which you can find here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaJSjgVEhMQ\n    * M -\u003e Music -\u003e Spotify\n    * I -\u003e IM -\u003e Messages\n    * F -\u003e Files -\u003e Open Downloads Folder\n    * G -\u003e Google Chrome -\u003e Chrome\n    * C -\u003e Calendar -\u003e Fantastical\n    * T -\u003e TickTick -\u003e TickTick\n    * Z -\u003e Zoom -\u003e Zoom\n    * D -\u003e Obsi**d**ian -\u003e Obsidian\n    * E -\u003e Editor -\u003e Sublime Text\n    * S -\u003e Slack -\u003e Slack\n* **Hyper Key**\n  * This gives me an extra set of Keyboard Shortcut triggers without having to develop Carpel Tunnel or having to leave my home row. I used to bind many keyboard shortcuts to CTRL+ALT+COMMAND, but then I would have to leave the home row with the right hand which just leads to typing mistakes when trying to migrate back afterwards. Having the hyper key allows me to do those same shortcuts with my pinky finger on my left hand.\n    * CAPS_LOCK to HYPER (SHIFT+COMMAND+OPTION+CONTROL) or ESCAPE (If Alone)\n    * Hyper + i/j/k/l == vim directional Keys\n* **HJKL Arrow Keys**\n  * Similar to the one above. I used to have one of the old Macbook Pros with the inverted T Arrow keys, and then with the unibody Macbooks with no ports they decided to screw that up. I had a ton of muscle memory for getting to those keys and never could get that back since they changed this. So last year I decided that I was going to move my arrow keys to the home row so I wouldn't have to leave it. This configuration also has Hyper + G for beginning of line and Hyper + ; for end of line, but I honestly never use those.  I just use Hyper+Command+H or L, there's too much muscle memory there that I can't seem to give up.\n* **Shift+Escape to Tilde**\n  * This is largely just a symptom of having a 65% keyboard and needing to type a tilde where there's no key for it. This is what I chose. I have more 65% keyboard hacks in my Keyboard itself that I should probably do a video on. Let me know in the comments if you have any interest in that. \n\n[Karabiner](../Karabiner.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.144031139-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Quickly-Mark-Up-Mac-Screenshots-on-iPad-Skitch-vs-Markup":{"title":"Quickly Mark Up Mac Screenshots on iPad (Skitch vs Markup)","content":"\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.607118186-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Reflecting-on-a-year-on-YouTube":{"title":"Reflecting on a year on YouTube","content":"\nHey there, everyone.

A file can only be in one folder and I think that makes sense in a traditional file system, but one of the benefits of [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) is that the structure of your files emerges through the references and use of that note via your graph database. To force a traditional folder structure here is limiting the benefits of that system and creating unnecessary effort in maintenance by moving files from folder to folder. \n\nOne thing I do use from the *PARA* method is having a projects folder and enumerating those at the top of [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md). This helps me to keep focus on what I should be working on instead of meandering around my garden. Don't get me wrong, I still do plenty of that, but I'm working to have a bit more intention when I'm in the garden.\n\nI could see tagging or backlinking your areas so that you could produce a dashboard or dataview of them, but I have operationalized my Areas via my task manager, in this case [Akiflow](../Akiflow.md), as that's where I'm going to make sure I meet my expected standard there. \n\nIn my opinion, everything in your garden is a resource, so no need for a folder for that. \n\nFor me, I avoid the archive in hopes of repurposing any of these project notes as a document in my public garden, but I could see if you are a major user of fleeting notes putting those into an archive.\n\nSo I've mentioned that I don't think *PARA* is a perfect fit for [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md), but that doesn't mean that it is not useful. It has been amazing in organizing my *Google Drive*, I recently consolidated and organized all of my local documents and cloud files and I feel very good about *PARA* for this.\n\nI also use the *Arc browser* and that also lends itself very nicely to the use of *PARA*. I have contexts for my different environments (Personal, Work, [YouTube](../YouTube.md)) and projects for each. I can see Areas and Resources working here. If you would like to see more about the *Arc browser* and how I use it, let me know down in the comments.\n\nIf you've implemented *PARA* in your life, I would love to hear about your experience and what has worked and what hasn't.

I really like the idea of VIM. The ability to move around the page completely with your keyboard is right up my alley. So much so that I use [Vimium](../Vimium.md) within Chrome. The ability to find and jump to any element on the page or click on any button with a few keystrokes is amazing. If you're interested in that, I have a video all about [Vimium](../Vimium.md). The issue is that every app you use has to support VIM movements to make the payoff worthwhile. There are tools like *kindaVim* that try to bring a VIM experience to MacOS, but it still doesn't feel fully baked. We're most of the way there, but you can't use VIM commands in URL fields or to navigate within Electron apps and it's just too painful to have these superpowers and to only be able to use them 80% of the time. Not to mention, I worry a bit about betting my entire ability to work my computer on one app that intends to be paid. It seems like a great way to get held ransom in the future.\n\nI'm sure at this point you're like \"Brandon, if you're so against VIM what are you going to use instead?\" I'm going to use my keyboard, just remapped a bit. The key thing I find myself hating about my current keyboard setup that I have tried to fix with VIM is rapid navigation and selection. I feel like I've gotten most of the way there by borrowing a handful of navigation commands from *Jason Rudolph*'s [Keyboard](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard)\nwhich I call [Super Duper Keyboard](../Super%20Duper%20Keyboard.md). It allows me to get Command, Option, Shift and all the arrow keys without having to leave the home row. Yes, this isn't all the power of VIM, but it gets me the parts that I feel I use constantly and I'm confident that they work everywhere because it just uses native MacOS cursor navigation just with the convenience of being on the home row.\n\nFull disclosure, as of the time of this writing: I have only been using this for about two weeks, so it's not fully in muscle memory yet, but it feels surprisingly natural.\n\n## Key Features:\n\n* Cursor Movement without leaving the home row\n* Move a Word forward and back\n* Move to end of line, beginning of line\n* Selection with each of them\n* Lastly, delete a word forward or back (I currently have it on the default of alt+h and alt+l, but I'm considering moving those to hyper+h and hyper+l)\n\n**Mentioned in this article:** \n\n* [VIM](../VIM.md)\n* [Vimium](../Vimium.md)\n* *kindaVim* — [Link](https://kindavim.app/)\n* Jason Rudolph's [Super Duper Keyboard](../Super%20Duper%20Keyboard.md)\n* [Karabiner](../Karabiner.md)\n* [Hammerspoon](../Hammerspoon.md)\n\n### If you are a VIM user, I would love to know what is the feature that makes it worth it, feel free to use the link below to email me.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.5995428-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/reMarkable-2":{"title":"reMarkable 2","content":"\nSo you are looking into purchasing an eInk tablet and you've come across the reMarkable 2. They have the best marketing of all the eInk tablet manufacturers.  I've tested the [Boox Note Air 2 Plus](../Boox%20Note%20Air%202%20Plus.md), the [Supernote A5 X](../Supernote%20A5%20X.md) and now the reMarkable 2. In this video I will tell you about the reMarkable 2, how it stacks up against the competitors and who is and isn't a good fit for this device. \n\nWhen I first started researching eInk tablets, the reMarkable 2 was the first tablet I came across. It was simple, well-designed and looked great. I ultimately passed on it because I didn't like their business model of charging for their connectivity tools, like exporting notes to Google Drive or screen-sharing. It also didn't have a backlight or Kindle support, so I bought the Boox Note Air 2 Plus instead. I did a review on that and after that review I was getting a bunch of questions about how the Boox compared, but I didn't have a point of reference to compare it to so I ultimately bought a reMarkable 2, so I could compare. \n\nFor full transparency, this video is NOT sponsored. This is my own personal reMarkable 2 that I paid for with my own money. \n\n## Form Factor, Design \u0026 Build Quality\n\n* Design-wise it is an amazingly designed piece of hardware. It looks and feels premium. \n  * These little rubber feet on the back are a nice touch and prevent the device from sliding around the table.\n  * I like the way they hid the charge port in the bottom-left of the device\n  * The sleep button being on the top also feels great.\n  * The white bezels are beautiful.\n  * The device is taller than the Boox, but is thinner. It's only slightly thinner, but you can tell. I really enjoy the form factor of the reMarkable. \n  * I think it feels more premium than the Boox Note Air 2 Plus and significantly more so than the Supernote A5 X.\n  * I love that the sides are less rounded than the Boox so that the magnetic pen actually stays where it's supposed to\n* Similarly to the Supernote there is no backlight on this device. They do this to minimize the distance between the pen tip and the eInk rendering to make the handwriting more convincing, but I don't find the Boox's backlit display to feel inferior to write on.\n  * There is no backlight, but the screen is at least bright white so as long as you have a decent amount of light you will be able to see what is going on well.\n* It does have a glass front and back and is breakable. I would treat this the way I would a laptop. It should go in a padding pocket in your bag if you're going to put it in one.\n  * If you want a device that doesn't feel as nice, but can take more abuse, then check out the Supernote A5 X\n\n## Writing Look \u0026 Feel\n\n* When I first got the reMarkable, I was extremely confused by it. It had ultra low-latency, great tooling and attention to detail, but the handwritten text looked awful. I was perplexed by it and on more than one occasion I wondered to myself \"why do people like this device?\" It felt inherently flawed. It turns out the device isn't bad, just the fineliner is. I absolutely hate the writing look and feel of the fineliner. And somehow was the pen that was selected (I think because I like fineliners in real life). Once I found the Ballpoint pen, nearly all of my issues were solved. \n* The handwriting has extremely low latency. It has the lowest latency of all the devices, and feels great, but I would gladly trade some latency for better anti-aliasing\n  * A leaked beta build showed that they were working on anti-aliasing on page turn which would be a very clever way to maintain the low latency while still having great looking and convincing handwriting after the fact. \n* reMarkable has in my opinion the most satisfying writing feel of all the devices.\n  * Similar to the Boox, but perhaps a bit more rough. \n    * The continuum is reMarkable roughest (traditional pencil), Boox is ever so slightly smoother (mechanical pencil) and the SuperNote is much smoother (gel pen on pad of paper)\n  * Visceral and fluid without any of the fatigue of real paper\n* Be aware of screen magnitization, when I first got the device I thought I got a bad digitizer because the lines were not lining up with where I was writing (especially near the edges of the device), but I found out the device was just being magnetized by the other devices I was using near it. You can slide your stylus sideways across the device to make this issue go away.  [Link to magnetization info](https://github.com/reMarkable/linux/issues/13)\n\n## Software\n\n* The software is simple, and that's a good thing. \n  * You open the device and you have a single list of documents. Some that you created on the device and some that may have imported as PDFs.\n* Everything about the software feels snappy and responsive.\n  * Page flips \n  * The device wakes very quickly\n  * It seems like reMarkable truly uses the device themselves and it feels like it values my time the most of any of the three devices.\n  * I like the keyboard a lot, but it does feel weird that they don't have the handwriting to text like the Boox device. \n* I found myself after a few minutes going, is that it? Is that all it can do, but after using it in practice I love that everything is in one place because it leads to me processing the documents I create instead of them languishing on the device forever\n* This device is a high-powered notebook, and that's about it\n  * This device can do some basic reading of PDFs, but no Kindle support. After using all of these devices, I come to the conclusion that if you want to read a simple novel, just use a Kindle. It's the best experience for that. \n* Quick sheets is a lovely way to take a quick note without having to throw it into the wrong notebook. It's a little thing, but a nice touch.\n* Per page tagging is very handy. I use it to ensure I transfer all of my important notes back to my source of truth. (Notion for work things and Obsidian for personal)\n  * You can also do document level tagging\n* Aside from tags there are no clever titles feature or stars for tasks like on the SuperNote, so if you are looking for something to replace your daily planner you should probably look at the SuperNote (I will have my review of that linked above)\n* The highlighter is beautiful and delightful to use\n  * When in PDFs it aligns with the text you're highlighting\n    * I haven't found a good off the shelf solution to easily get these highlights off of the device. There is the rmApi project that can successfully pull this data, but the project that attempts to do this appears broken since a recent reMarkable Api update. Here's hoping someone can find a way to integrate it with [Readwise](../Readwise.md). If no one does, I might write something at some point. \n* The tablet runs on Linux. For context the Supernote and Boox run on Android. The linux architecture opens up significant room to tinker and I believe is a significant factor in how snappy the device feels. \n  * For my particular device I use the DDVK Hack which is a patched firmware to fill in some missing functionality in the base reMarkable UX\n    * Quick Tool Switching\n    * Gestures to quick swap between two documents\n      * This opens up the ability to read and keep notes in a separate document or two switch between two frequently used notebooks.\n        * For example a personal notebook and a work notebook\n    * Ability to see your active tool when you disable the UI\n    * Ability to use the eraser button with non-reMarkable stylus (be sure to install the additional stylus hack it is not bundled with the base package)\n    * Easy undo/redo gestures (not as good as SuperNote but still really good)\n    * I turned off the Bookmarking gesture \n    * Out of the box the device is not very left friendly because of the back button in the top right\n  * With the DDVK hacks I think the reMarkable software is very close to as good as Supernote's which I regard as the best when it comes to usability for writing and getting things done. \n    * If you aren't, intending on installing the DDVK hacks, then you might find it a little barebones. \n\n* In my opinion, reMarkable has the best companion app of the tablets. \n  * It's nice to be able to load up the reMarkable app on my Mac and see all of my notes there instead of having to flip to it on my tablet, if all I want to do is review things. \n  * Synchronization is very quick and I don't find myself having to manually sync. It just works and that is awesome. \n  * You can do this even without the connect membership, but thats a bit moot with reMarkable's recent change to give majority of the connect features for free. \n\n* The out-of-the-box templates are plentiful and well-designed. The dot grid template on the reMarkable is better than the default one of the Boox.\n  * I have since emulated that template on the Boox and the Supernote\n* I will note that the reMarkable software hasn't evolved or improved in the time I have had the device. There have been a couple bug fix updates, but that's it. Their team did announce that they have big changes coming towards the end of the year and hopefully that's why we haven't seen any real updates.\n\n## Business Practices\n\n* Putting Google Drive syncing and screensharing behind a monthly fee feels weird and honestly probably loses them some customers. (They have since fixed this as of 9/21/22, Well done reMarkable)\n* I do like that they don't bundle their stylus in with the device. This brings the overall price of the device down significantly. I think $279 USD if you use a referral code. I will include mine in the description if you decide you want to pick up the device. I don't like that they overcharge for their stylus, making it look like you can get the device for $259, but by the time you get through checkout you are looking at close to $400 dollars because their stylus is $129. \n  * Making it so that the Eraser on third-party styluses doesn't work is a slimy way to sell more overpriced Markers. reMarkable if you make your markers worthy of their price people will prefer them over the competing styluses. \n\n## Wish List\n\n* I wish I could write in the titles of my notebooks. The Boox does this very well. It's surprising it's not here on the reMarkable\n* ANTI-ALIASING!\n* I wish screen-sharing wasn't locked behind a monthly fee. This has been fixed as of 9/21/22\n* Make other people's stylus work out of the box. \n* Let me keep my common pens together on the toolbar and also let me have them persist across notebooks\n* I wish my notebooks were synced in the background on idle instead of having to go to the home screen.\n* The device is minimalist, and I like minimalism, but this feels a bit too minimalist\n  * If I want to move my toolbar to the bottom of the screen I should be able to\n  * I wish there was a way to refresh the screen manually. This device has more ghosting than the Boox or SuperNote. It's not a big deal, but when you get some you are largely helpless to it.\n  * I wish it had a lasso stroke eraser. That is my favorite style of eraser\n* I wish it did smart shapes like in GoodNotes\n\n## Conclusion / Who should buy this?\n\nThe reMarkable 2 is the iPhone of eInk tablets. Its feature-set is limited, but it does the right things and does those very well. The device is very simple and intuitive. Perhaps barebones, but it is the tablet I pick up when I want to think or explore an idea.\n\nIf you decide to pick up a reMarkable and consider me a friend, you can use my referral code to save $40. https://remarkable.com/referral/JQC4-N95E\n\n### Meta\n\n[reMarkable resources when getting started](reMarkable%20Resources%20when%20getting%20started.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.584262738-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/reMarkable-Resources-when-getting-started":{"title":"reMarkable Resources when getting started","content":"\n## rM2 Template Making\n\n[rM2 Template Helper \u0026 Custom Screens](https://www.freeremarkabletools.com/index.asp?ds=ok)\nhttps://youtu.be/7FHBSLMShVc\n[Whitelines for Remarkable](https://github.com/steka/reMarkable_templates)\nhttps://github.com/Templarian/Remarkable\nhttps://rm.ezb.io/\n\n## rM2 Highlights\n\n[Python Library for pulling Remarkable highlights](https://remarking.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)\n\n## Screensharing\n\nhttps://github.com/rien/reStream\nhttps://github.com/bordaigorl/rmview\n\n## Screen Alignment Issues\n\n[Example and how to fix magnetization](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/m82oes/do_you_experience_the_same_weird_bug/?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=ios_app\u0026utm_name=iossmf)\n\n## Remarkable Hacking\n\n[DDVK Hack](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-hacks)\n\n* [Stylus Hack for use with DDVK](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-stylus)\n  [Standalone Stylus Hack](https://github.com/isaacwisdom/RemarkableLamyEraser)\n  [GitHub - funkey/recept: Pen event interception for line smoothing on the reMarkable 2 tablet](https://github.com/funkey/recept/)\n  https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/78u90n/passwordless_ssh_setup_for_remarkable_tablet/ (Optional, but helpful)\n  http://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/\n\n## Meta\n\n[blog/reMarkable 2](reMarkable%202.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.540888115-04:00","tags":null},"/cooking/Brussels-Sprouts":{"title":"Brussels Sprouts","content":"\n*Cooking*\n\n*2022-01-13* Halved until all about the same size.

In this case I halved a bag of brussels sprouts. Add meat to an ungreased pan as the liquid provides enough grease. This time I did 2 minutes per side. I think for next time I should try 2:30. Result: Good sear, perhaps a little too done in places and not enough in others. Perhaps a weight could help to create good contact. The cook was very Medium Rare, could be slightly more done by my standards, but this should largely be a judgement call based on the thickness of the cut. These were reasonably thick by Trader Joe's standard, but if you got a good butchered cut you would need more time.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.419422568-04:00","tags":null},"/cooking/Smoked-Chicken-Dry-Rub":{"title":"Smoked Chicken Dry Rub","content":"\n## INGREDIENTS\n\n* 2 tablespoon garlic powder\n* 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar\n* 1 teaspoon paprika\n* 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper\n* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne\n* 1 tablespoon onion powder\n* 1 teaspoon chili powder\n\nSource: https://fitfoodiefinds.com/smoked-chicken-dry-rub-recipe/\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.436754956-04:00","tags":null},"/cooking/Smoked-Chuck-Roast":{"title":"Smoked Chuck Roast","content":"\n*2022-03-26*\nI did my first smoked chuck roast.

I wrapped it at 175 degrees and finished it in the over because I was running out of fire. The flavor turned out excellent with good smoky notes. The fatty pieces were nice and juicy, but the lean parts were a bit dry and tough. I perhaps could have wrapped it earlier to prevent it was from drying out. I also perhaps could have cooked it on a lower temperature.

I did this one at 225, but it got a little hot towards the start. I built a nice big fire, but ended up accidentally putting it out trying to temp it down. In the future, I need to close the cover sooner and cut the oxygen to it before it gets too hot. I cooked the chicken around ~225° until it reached 145°, and then I opened it up in an attempt to get the skin crispy. I think it may have worked, but then I applied the BBQ sauce and that lost any crisp I achieved. I put three pieces of hickory in with the fire today and I think that was too much. For the next one I do, I am going to try a dry rub and not apply a BBQ sauce to see how the skin does this.\n\n\n*2022-04-03*\nDid another Spatchcock Chicken today this time with some new techniques thanks to Dave. I brined the chicken is salt water and some pickle juice for a few hours prior to cooking. (Next time I do it I need to try to dehydrate the skin by drying it off and putting it back into the fridge for a few hours). I brushed it with olive oil on both sides (perhaps I should only do that on the bottom side) and I coated it in a new rub I found here: https://fitfoodiefinds.com/smoked-chickljken-dry-rub-recipe/. I did my typical cook at 220 until 145 degrees and then cranked up the temperature to 275ish to crisp the skin. The skin still didn't turn out quite crispy enough but its getting better. I then finished it with the South Carolina BBQ sauce and let that cook on it for 5 minutes or so. The flavor was great and having the BBQ sauce on the outside gave great flavor. \nThis was the first time I've tried serving the chicken in whole pieces. I need to rewatch [How to Brine and Spatchcock a Chicken](../sources/How%20to%20Brine%20and%20Spatchcock%20a%20Chicken.md) to review the proper way to cut a chicken.\n\n### Prior to Sauce\n\n\n\n### Post-Sauce\n\n\n\n### Served for Dinner with *Dad* and *Lois*\n\n\n\n*2022-03-27*\nThis was my second attempt at a Spatchcock Chicken. This time around, we went with a 50/50 mix of salt and pepper. I smoked the Chicken at 250 degree until 145 degrees and then attempted to increase the heat to 275, but unfortunately we had run out of wood and I couldn't get the temperature to rise. I think I've been erring on the side of too little fuel, but there is very little downside to more fuel. I also used significantly too much seasoning this time around, and it was very salty. The amount the first time was right, I just didn't care for the rub much. The meat itself was wonderfully tender, but the skin turned too salty and wasn't crispy enough.\n\n\n*2022-03-20*\nThis was my first time using the *Char-Griller Akorn*. I set an initial fire in the Akorn to get it to 400 degrees to season the grill grate. This worked well, and I had no issues getting the grill to high temperature, even getting it past 500 degrees. I had a minor challenge where I put the fire out while trying to reduce the temperature significantly to get back to a smoking temperature after running it at high heat. After relighting the fire I cooked the chicken between 225 and 275 for an hour and half until the chicken got to an internal temperature of 145 degrees. At the point, I raised the heat to 325 to crisp up the skin and make it easier to get the chicken to temperature. For this chicken we used a KC BBQ rub along with mayonnaise and olive oil on the underside. Initially I didn't put enough seasoning on the chicken, but we later added a bit more. The fire was likely 8 to 2 lump to hickory. The chicken was cooked very nicely, but I found the rub to be too sweet for chicken (its probably better suited for pork). I may try something simpler like just salt and pepper next time to see how that compares. For this cook, we were lacking the smoking stone, but were able to substitute in a baking sheet instead for today. The smoking stone will be here tomorrow along with a thermometer that will talk to my phone so that I can monitor the fire from afar. \n\n\n---\n\n### References\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JJx4eZNmz4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0de3Q9hQSTA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y7gM1deyvw\u0026t=1s\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.486467371-04:00","tags":null},"/eInk-Tablet-Styluses":{"title":"eInk Tablet Styluses","content":"\n### Rankings\n\n1.

But as it is, Siddhartha can wait calmly. He is not impatient. He is not in need. He can ward off hunger for a long time and laugh at it.

Who do you think of when you hear the word successful? Quote? The first answer to any question is a much fun because it's just automatic. What's the first painting that comes to mind? Mona Lisa. Name a genius. Einstein Who's a composer. Mozart. This is the subject of the book, Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. There's the instant, unconscious automatic thinking, and then there's the slower, conscious, rational, deliberate thinking. I'm really, really into the slower thinking, breaking my automatic responses to the things in my life and slowly thinking through a more deliberate response. Instead, then for the things in life where an automatic ([Time 0:30:21](https://www.airr.io/quote/618bf5ea3aae6012c8528f04))\n\n---\n\nthat comes to mind? Why are they actually more successful than the first person that came to mind? In that case, the first would be Richard Branson because he's the stereotype. He's like the Mona Lisa of success to me. Honestly, you might be my second answer, but we could talk about that a different time. My third and riel answer after thinking it through, is that we can't know without knowing a person's aims. What if Richard Branson set out to live a quiet life, but like a compulsive gambler, he just can't stop creating companies. Then that changes everything, and we can call him successful anymore.

You've probably heard the fable. I think it's Borodin's ass about a donkey who is standing halfway between a pile of hay and a bucket of water. He just keeps looking left to the hay and right to the water, trying to decide. Hey or water Hey! Or water. He's unable to decide, so he eventually falls over and dies of both hunger and thirst. A donkey can't think of the future. If he did, he'd realize he could clearly go first to drink the water. Then go eat the hay. So my advice to my 30 year old self is, don't be a donkey. You can do everything you want to do. You just need foresight and patients. ([Time 0:34:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/619135213aae6012c8371501))\n\n---\n\nstartup vacation starting in late 2015.

I was on the phone with my friend Amber Room Barth, who's a brilliant musician, and I was lamenting about this. She's the one who pointed out. It sounds like from where you are, your decision is not between yes and no.

The answer is a Toyota, because the Toyota Meet spec. It more reliably does exactly what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it than Rolls Royce does. Rolls Royce is a different thing.

I tend to have a day dedicated to different types of work. So Tuesday will involve lots and lots of phone calls or at least that's when I'll batch my phone calls with my team and with other people.

Really, this is an energetic canary in the coal mine, for me, in the sense that if you find yourself low energy, which is very often accompanied by depressive or pessimistic thoughts, then I will do a number of things including 8020 analysis and some form of dream lining is outlined in the four hour workweek.

Like how quickly do you fall asleep and how do you feel when you first wake up, when you first wake up? Is there a feeling of dread of, Oh fuck, I have to slog through another day of not really knowing where I'm going or is it a different feeling?

And secondly, some of my hesitation has been around my genetic predisposition and it is a genetic predisposition.

If you have the ability to pause even for a few seconds before reflexively responding, say in anger or in anything if you have the ability to be more self aware so that you can regulate more effectively. Will that make you more effective or will that make you less effective? I think it will make you more effective.

So if the secret to happiness is low expectations, as I was told by one of my danish friends when I asked them why Denmark rated as one of the happiest countries on earth, then perhaps the key to overcoming the fear of being misunderstood is just to assume that everyone misunderstands everyone and that there is no point that it is pissing in the wind to try to prevent people from misunderstanding you.

This is your title, thumbnail, and first 30 seconds of your video. Things that should grab the attention of a potential viewer and keep them watching. Then you move on to the Intro. Once they’ve decided to watch your video, you need to explain the why behind it. Tell your viewers why they should keep watching, what you’re explaining/providing/going to show and how that thing relates to their situation. Next is Value. Throughout the whole video, you want to show the value of your production through elements of writing (video script) and branding (video editing). The point is to make it memorable and to stand out compared to the rest of the productions in the same niche. Here’s where you make them say “Wow, they really took time to make this video special.” And you want to finish it off with the End Screen Sales Pitch. You don’t want to leave your viewers with anything. The best thing you can do is relate the end bit of a video with another video on that correlating topic. Take a look at this video as an example. This way you’ll keep them in a loop and you create a situation where people genuinely want to check out your next video. And given that they’ve already watched one of your videos until the end chances are that they’ll like to watch the next one. #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.683764668-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/-the-Most-Productive-Week-of-My-Life":{"title":"✅ the Most Productive Week of My Life","content":"\n# ✅ the Most Productive Week of My Life\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Ali Abdaal*\n* Full Title: ✅ the Most Productive Week of My Life\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nIf you want to get stuff done rather than “feel” productive, Cal recommends *completion-centric planning.* At the start of your work day, identify your most important project and ask yourself “what’s the closest I can get to finishing this today?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g6qm1r1zp0mwq4y1drvsg8sq)) \n\n[Daily Highlight](../Daily%20Highlight.md)\n\n---\n\nSo the next time you feel you’re not getting much done, try asking yourself “How close can I get to finishing my most important project, today??” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g6qm55aq7qnsqgpdx9xm75ga))\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.279014036-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/1-Janis-Ozolins-on-Twitter-How-I-approach-visual-content-creation.-httpst.co4TsmssrEXM-Twitter":{"title":"(1) Janis Ozolins on Twitter How I approach visual content creation. httpst.co4TsmssrEXM  Twitter","content":"\n# (1) Janis Ozolins on Twitter: \"How I approach visual content creation. https://t.co/4TsmssrEXM\" / Twitter\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Janis Ozolins*\n* Full Title: (1) Janis Ozolins on Twitter: \"How I approach visual content creation. https://t.co/4TsmssrEXM\" / Twitter\n* URL: https://twitter.com/OzolinsJanis/status/1392436317846376448?s=20\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nI respect your time.

Perhaps you’ve experienced just such an awkward window of time like this — such as in-between Zoom meetings or something. And so, allow me to suggest a few ways to spend those few minutes... If you Use Day One scroll through your Day One timeline and read a previous journal entry. Browse some old photos and memories. Launch Day One (or any other journal you have) and log how you’ve spent your time so far for the day. Doing this for a few weeks can also be super helpful for getting a perspective of where your time and energy are being spent. Write down 3 new ideas. These could be articles you want to write, business ideas, places you want to visit or photograph, topics you want to research, date ideas for you and your spouse, gift ideas for a friend, etc. These ideas never have to to be acted on — the point isn’t to generate a to-do list, but rather to exercise your mind. Ideation and creativity are muscles, and the more we exercise them the stronger they get. Send a text message to a friend or family member to tell them how awesome they are. Stand up and do some stretching / body movement. #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.841892086-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/2x2-Lists-Lists-Lists....-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail":{"title":"2x2 Lists, Lists, Lists.... - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail","content":"\n# 2x2: Lists, Lists, Lists.... - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Create account*\n* Full Title: 2x2: Lists, Lists, Lists.... - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n* URL: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzGmvTxVKczjwkdlWKjTnzhdKbbf\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nI’ve been using Day One as my journal app for about a decade.

A new approach to journaling that I picked up about a month ago, is something that makes it very easy to create a Day One entry. And, more often than not, it leads me to continue writing. The approach is to simply finish this sentence: “Today was a good day because....”. \n\n---\n\nOne type of goal is an attainment goal: something with a clear definition of completion that you achieve or accomplish. The other type is a Lifestyle Goal: a habit or routine that you incorporate into your everyday lifestyle.

To become a small expert. To become the best person on the internet at understanding the application of Medicaid to minority children, or something like that. And the reason why I think this is true I call my Tokyo example. If you go to Tokyo, you'll see there are all sorts of really, really strange shops. There'll be a shop that's only 1970's vinyl and like, 1980's whisky or something. And that doesn't make any sense if it's a shop in a Des Moines suburb, right? In a Des Moines suburb, to exist, you have to be Subway. You have to hit the mass-market immediately. But in Tokyo, where there's 30-40 million people within a train ride of a city, then your market is 40 million. And within that 40 million, sure, there's a couple thousand people who love 1970's music and 1980's whisky. The Internet is Tokyo.

High-quality leisure has three main components.\nFirst, it involves demanding activity instead of passive consumption. It means not sitting in front of the TV, but doing something that requires effort from you.\nSecond, high-quality leisure is often working that produces something in the physical world. It’s painting, planting a garden, or fixing bikes. It’s activity away from the digital world.\nThird, high-quality leisure regularly includes interactions with others.

You have a website that says you are a person that likes clean modern design, whereas you can imagine there's this, what is it called? The Professor style website, which is these kind of like very bare bones. Html You know, not only is it not responsive design but it's like barely even styled at all, but you come to associate it with often busy and successful professors who are very erudite and accomplished in their field and they do have a representation online but would almost be confusing or maybe feel wrong in some way if they had a sleek, well designed site, like a designer, would that conveys maybe the wrong idea? \nSpeaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

For example, I started the design details podcast because I wanted to meet other people and what we did is we created a spreadsheet of 100 people who we wanted to meet and just started going down the list and emailing them And everyone was super kind and most people were open to being on this brand new podcast with these young 20something designers trying to figure out what they ([Time 0:17:24](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b487ba62ce94f7a954390e)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: as a friendly person who responds quickly and thoughtfully and carefully. But then there is a little bit of a burden there I suppose. I mean a good burden to have. It's awesome that people want to reach out and chat but sometimes it's overwhelming. I'm curious if you both have experiences because you both are also quite public and put yourselves out there \nSpeaker 2: in general. I'm very bullish on this channel that is cold contact over the public \nSpeaker 0: internet in both \nSpeaker 2: directions. I think people underestimate the opportunities that you can create by sending a good cold email or cold DM as it may be. And I think there's also a lot of value potentially being open and I've always been open for a similar reason, I think to you is I was incredibly fortunate to have people help me out as I was entering Silicon Valley, basically. On the basis of cold emails, \nSpeaker 1: Mark, I feel ([Time 0:19:15](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b4882862ce94f7a9544b29)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: or there's the case that's clear spam or something close to spam, let's say not classic spam necessarily, but something where I don't know, you know, the recruiter, the classic recruiter thing. Oh, I see you have a ruby on rails project. I'm working with a company that, you know, they clearly just didn't look at my profile for more than five seconds. The middle ground I think is the harder thing where someone does know me personally in my work, they are writing to me saying, hey, you know, I've enjoyed what you've done at, I don't know what you can switch muse whatever and here's the thing I'm doing. You know, I'm a student, I'm an entrepreneur, I'm something else.

But then if that doesn't lead into like a real clear request, it's more just a general, like I'd like to get to know you or it's just unclear what they're asking for and then maybe it's a long email and then it's like, It is thoughtful and it's in this middle ground that's tricky and it's hard to know 100% what to do with it. I still try to like find a good reply if I can, but it's often ends up being more of a thanks for the nice words. I think you're doing something interesting. You know, if there's some specific thing you're looking for, let me know. But this kind of comes to the rules for emailing busy people thing, right?

But the 1% of people who do are really special and I feel like that's where you build really cool relationships, is you know, ([Time 0:24:04](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b4894962ce94f7a9547597)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: and I feel like that's where you build really cool relationships, is you know, somebody asks, hey, I'm weighing these two offers at a job, what do you think I should do? And I'll tell you what I think and then they respond, they say, hey, by the way I ended up doing this and even better as they say, oh, I did this and I learned this, right. And so one thing that I've started doing now recently with sort of these kinds of engagements with people, I don't know where it feels a little bit transactional as I try and explicitly request a follow up and the way I frame it is, hey, by the way, if you end up making a decision, I would love to hear how you made that decision if you learned anything. So a lot of times this will end up being like job hunting or negotiation, ([Time 0:24:44](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b4897262ce94f7a9547a3c)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 2: purposely build a brand as a first class goal and want to have a lot of followers either because they just enjoy playing that game or because they're in some type of role. We're having access to that marketing channel is valuable if they're developer advocate or they write a newsletter, someone like that and that again, is that sort of classical brand that you would think of if you compare it to something like coca cola, I think of it more as an asset that I can draw on when needed. So I don't particularly need any followers. I need the ability to point to something and say, hey, I'm reaching out to you, you can refer to this artifact and see that I'm a truthful person and that's really all that I personally and I think that covers most people now. there's a bit of a ([Time 0:27:26](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b48a1462ce94f7a9548c38)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 2: something good and valuable to say versus having a stock of reputational capital in \nSpeaker 0: the form of a bunch of followers. \nSpeaker 1: Mhm. Although being known for saying things that people want to hear definitely is a huge amplifier on anything you might say, which is maybe to that fortune cookie point, you can say basically pretty generic platitudes, but if your audience is big enough for you have this reputation where people just care about what you have to say, then yeah, they're excited about what would otherwise be a pretty bland statement. The other piece of this on the followers though is I would say that quality is not the right word, it's people who are following me for the right reason and I especially like the mutual follows and maybe the mutual followers thing just kind of takes you back to a little more of a classic social network where you have people who sort of all know ([Time 0:31:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b48b8762ce94f7a954bf51)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: the algorithm becomes very apparent, you can watch it in real time, take hold and you very subtly understand or maybe subconsciously understand what is going to get likes and what will probably not get likes and it just breaks your brain. At least I'll say it breaks my brain because it puts you in this position where you are tempted and also rewarded for oversimplifying polarizing, tweeting the hot take, criticizing those kinds of things. I think a good example that I ([Time 0:34:01](https://www.airr.io/quote/62b48c1a62ce94f7a954d31c)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: back to a concept we talked about in the company brand episode which is there's what's known as brand extension. And the general thing is the brand extension is basically a pretty bad idea and almost never works. So, you know, for example, Kleenex is known for making facial tissue if Kleenex makes printer paper, which perhaps is a similar product in the sense of how it's manufactured. Not only is it confusing withheld as Kleenex printer paper, but you've actually destroyed the brand equity of what Kleenexes in the mind of your customer and the recommendation there is generally make a new brand if you're truly transitioning to a different market.

But a big difference between a traditional rest application and the music player is that there are two completely separate layers, what we call the network layer and the app layer. So the network layer is responsible for shuffling these binary blobs around the transactional data, the ephemeral data and the big binary assets and the server knows absolutely nothing about what's inside of them by design, both, because we don't want to have to re implement all of them use logic about boards and cards or whatever in the \nSpeaker 0: server.

Comprehensive difficulty relates to understanding the rules of the game while executive difficulty is about physicality (e.g. fast reflexes, coordination). Strategic difficulty relates to how to use your understanding of the rules and your reflexes to best master the game, your opponent, or yourself.\n\n---\n\nArs Technica’s Kyle Orland listed “five noncomprehensive subcategories” of gaming difficulty. Mechanical difficulty is about reflexes, punishing difficulty relates to how much of penalty you pay for mistakes (e.g. does the game make you start from the beginning when you die), arcane difficulty is about how much the game helps you learn to play, grindable difficulty is about the game giving you an option to power up via spending a lot of time performing tedious actions, and difficulty walls is about the presence of “impassable walls that fully impeded a player’s progress\n\n---\n\nEven the hardest mountain can be ground down by a gentle stream if given enough time. Similarly, some games that seem tough at first can eventually be completed if you’re willing to put in the time to grind out improvements to your character’s power level.\nIn a game like Super Meat Boy, there’s no item you can find to make a difficult series of jumps any easier. In Elden Ring, on the other hand, the game can become significantly easier as you put in more time collecting the runes and items needed to power up your character level, weapons, and spells.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.469757987-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/A-Tip-for-Delivering-Great-Design-Feedback-During-a-Critique-by-Chris-Lee-Aug-2021-UX-Collective":{"title":"A Tip for Delivering Great Design Feedback During a Critique  by Chris Lee  Aug, 2021  UX Collective","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Chris Lee*\n* Full Title: A Tip for Delivering Great Design Feedback During a Critique | by Chris Lee | Aug, 2021 | UX Collective\n* Category:\n* URL: https://uxdesign.cc/a-tip-for-delivering-great-design-feedback-during-a-critique-2286e476127e?cmdid=OYHX9249KIH7UN\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nMake sure you accurately represent the user and the real questions they would be asking if they encountered your product at the moment in time you’re planning on delivering it.

With a single line on the screen, you have just that single object, but adding a second line does something interesting, it adds a third ‘object’ on the screen, the negative space between the two. All good visual designers deeply understand this effect.\nIn UX design we have a cognitive equivalent. If you have two buttons, there is a third ‘object’ created, the decision a user must make on which button to tap.

List making was the death of creativity! I think a lot of creative people look at lists like that. But here is the thing: They are the natural part of any project of scale, and a logical list combined with a system of checkboxes will bring order to even the most unruly and complex project.\n\n---\n\nThe value of a list is that it frees you up to think more creatively, by defining a project’s scope and scale for you on the page, so your brain doesn’t have to hold on to so much information.\n[The value of a list is that it frees you up to think creatively](../The%20value%20of%20a%20list%20is%20that%20it%20frees%20you%20up%20to%20think%20creatively.md)\n\n---\n\nThe story genius Andrew Stanton, who cowrote the Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. franchises and directed both Finding Nemo and Finding Dory for Pixar, talked to me about this first pass at listing out the component parts of a project. He was consulting with a group recently, and they were working on the early stages of a project when he said to them, “Can we just all agree right now, this is going to suck? Whatever we’re talking about now, no matter how much we’re getting excited, let’s just all understand it’s going to be a mess.” They were shocked, wondering if he was insulting the project itself. He explained that no, he was simply letting them know that in a project with any amount of complexity, the early stages won’t look at all like the later stages, and he wanted to take the pressure off any members of the group who may have thought that quality was the goal in the early stages.\n[Sacrificial List](../Sacrificial%20List.md)\n\n---\n\nMark Frauenfelder, founding editor in chief of Make magazine, insists that “you’ve got to do at least six iterations, minimum, of any project before it starts getting good enough to share it with other people.” That very first iteration, what I call the brain dump, Mark calls “the quick and dirty stuff.”\n\n[Sacrificial List](../Sacrificial%20List.md)\n\n---\n\nStep 2 is to take that massive list and start to carve it into manageable chunks. #status/review \n\n---\n\nStep 4: Diving In I almost never begin at the beginning. Usually I examine the subcategorized list and I look for the toughest nut to crack. The real ass-kicker of a problem. The one for which I have the most difficulty imagining a solution at first glance. #status/review \n\n---\n\nStep 6: Put It Away for a Bit #status/review \n\n---\n\nI frequently abandon projects, for various reasons. Life, travel, TV shows, more important projects—there are lots of reasons that I’ll shelve some projects. Not permanently, but they’ll lie dormant for periods of anywhere from days to sometimes years. In those cases, I find it handy to make a list of exactly where I stand with that particular build: what I’ve gotten done; what I was planning to do next; what is needed for the next steps. Checkboxes here are vitally important, particularly for when I’m ready to come back to a project. I want to feel like I’ve made meaningful headway before taking a second crack at something, and seeing all those colored-in checkboxes really helps. #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.897155955-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Adding-Intention-to-Spaced-Repetition":{"title":"Adding Intention to Spaced Repetition","content":"\n# Adding Intention to Spaced Repetition\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://s3.amazonaws.com/readwiseio/2021/08/unnamed-2.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Daniel Doyon*\n* Full Title: Adding Intention to Spaced Repetition\n* URL: https://blog.readwise.io/adding-intention-to-spaced-repetition\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nIn Japanese martial art tradition, there is a concept known as **Shu Ha Ri**. As explained on Wikipedia:\n\"It is known that, when we learn or train in something, we pass through the stages of *shu*, *ha*, and *ri*. These stages are explained as follows. In shu, we repeat the forms and discipline ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebears created. We remain faithful to these forms with no deviation. Next, in the stage of ha, once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations. In this process the forms may be broken and discarded. Finally, in ri, we completely depart from the forms, open the door to creative technique, and arrive in a place where we act in accordance with what our heart/mind desires, unhindered while not overstepping laws.\" ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g6qmf1zvb6g69jk9bpjeenf8))\n\n[The cycle of beginner, intermediate, expert](../The%20cycle%20of%20beginner,%20intermediate,%20expert.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:29.133719113-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Alchemy":{"title":"Alchemy","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZF3I4S26L._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Rory Sutherland*\n* Full Title: Alchemy\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nI have chosen psycho-logic as a neutral and non-judgemental term. I have done this for a reason. When we do put a name to non-rational behaviour, it is usually a word like ‘emotion’, which makes it sound like logic’s evil twin. ‘You’re being emotional’ is used as code for ‘you’re being an idiot’. If you went into most boardrooms and announced that you had rejected a merger on ‘emotional grounds’, you would likely be shown the door. Yet we experience emotions for a reason – often a good reason for which we don’t have the words.

That’s not because they are expensive – most of them are very cheap indeed. No, he\\* will hate them because they don’t sit comfortably with his narrow, reductive worldview.

But I had misunderstood. Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what's not working. We all have lots of ideas, creations and projects. When you present one to the world and it's not a hit, don't keep pushing it as is. instead get back to improving and inventing. Don't waste years fighting uphill battles against locked doors. Improve or invent until you get that huge response (Page 11)\n\n---\n\nHow do you grade yourself?\nFor me, it's how many useful things I create, whether songs, companies, articles, websites, or anything else. If I create something that's not useful to others, it doesn't count. But I'm also not interested in doing something useful unless it needs my creative input.\nHow do you grade yourself?\nIt's important to know in advance, to make sure you're staying focused on what's honestly important to you, instead of doing what others thing you should (Page 37)\n\n---\n\nAs a business owner, when you screwed over by someone, you might be tempted to make a big grand policy that you think will prevent you ever getting screwed over again: One employee can't focus and spends his time surfing the Web. Instead of just firing or reassigning that person to more challenging work, the company installs an expensive content-approving firewall so that nobody can go to unapproved sites ever again.\nIt's important to resist that simplistic, angry, reactionary urge to punish everyone, and step back to look at the big picture. (Page 42)\n\n---\n\nYou should feel pain when you're unclear\nWhen writing an email to everyone, if I wasn't perfectly clear, I'd get twenty thousand confused replies, whihc would take my staff all week to reply to, costing me at least $5,000 plus lost morale. Ever if I was very clear but took more than a few sentences to explain something, I'd get thousands of replies from people who never read past the first few sentences. Writing the email to customers-carefully eliminating every unnecessary word, and reshaping every sentence to make sure it could not be misunderstood-would take me all day. One unclear sentence? Immediate $5,000 penalty. Ouch. Unfortunately, people writing websites don't get this kind of feedback. Instead, if they're not clear, they just get silence.

(Page 48)\n\n---\n\nWhen you want to learn how to do something yourself, most people won't understand. They'll assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way.\nBut that's forgetting about the joy of learning and doing. Yes, it may take longer. Yes, it may be inefficient. Yes, it may even cost you millions of dollars in lost opportunities because your business is growing slower because you're insisting on doing something yourself. But the whole point of doing anything is because it makes you happy. That's it! (Page 59)\n\n---\n\nSame Process.\n1. Gather everybody around.\n2. Answer the question and explain the philosophy.\n3.

Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.

It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.” Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong.

(Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.) But 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate. The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act.

So beautiful, in fact, that he immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by his more common possessions. He wrote that there was “no more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of his stuff. Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced his rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to place above the mantel, and a better kitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase led to the next. Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.

If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled with doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to grab one every now and then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1058))\n\n---\n\nHere are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious: If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter. If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand in the middle of the living room. If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack of stationery on your desk. If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and place them in common locations around the house.

By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you.

([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B07D23CFGR\u0026location=1121))\n\n---\n\nThink in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watches television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different people can have different memories—and thus different habits—associated with the same place. The good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context.

It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often.

It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run.

In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net. After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing.

We cannot do our best thinking and our best work when all the “stuff” from the past is crowding and cluttering our space.

The precious attention we invested in producing that in-between work gets thrown away, never to be used again. Because we manage most of our “work-in-process” in our head, as soon as we finish the project and step away from our desks, all that valuable knowledge we worked so hard to acquire dissolves from our memory like a sandcastle washed away by the ocean waves.

When she instead scanned the elderly, the amygdala fired only for the positive images. Carstensen hypothesizes that the elderly subjects had trained the prefrontal cortex to inhibit the amygdala in the presence of negative stimuli. These elderly subjects were not happier because their life circumstances were better than those of the young subjects; they were instead happier because they had rewired their brains to ignore the negative and savor the positive. By skillfully managing their attention, they improved their world without changing anything concrete about it.

We all know that proper planning helps us make better use of our time. So plan ahead. At the beginning of each week, work out the non-negotiables (meetings, deadlines, etc.) then schedule the remaining tasks around them. By creating a scheduled agenda of your activities (try an app like Spark Notebook) you will be more likely to follow through with each task and less likely to procrastinate.

However, pop music interferes with information processing and reading comprehension, so be selective with what you listen to while working, and save the top 40 chart bangers for non-working hours. Instead, try listening to white noise or ambient sounds, which have been proven to help with concentration. There are plenty of sound generators out there; try Noisli, a fantastic free background noise generator for both productivity and relaxation. Great when you need to block out a noisy environment.

So hide the phone, turn off pop-up alerts, and put some headphones on to signal to colleagues that you’re in your own zone. If there’s something else in your field of vision that might grab your attention (like a clock or a permanent news channel on a big monitor), remove it or reposition yourself so it’s not bothering you.

It’s a lose-lose and a waste of everyone’s time. However, if run effectively, meetings can be a powerful tool for team motivation, morale and (you guessed it) productivity. Set a clear agenda for the meeting, and set goals at the end with clear assignments, so everyone knows what they need to do by the next meeting. You can also banish devices, send out important information in advance, be more selective about attendees, and merciless with timekeeping.

Here are his top 5 - See if any of these make you more efficient with your inbox:\n1. Respond quickly. 2. When writing an email, every word matters, and useless prose doesn’t. Be crisp in your delivery.\n3. Clean out your inbox constantly. 4. Handle email in LIFO (last in, first out) order. 5. Ask yourself, “What should I have forwarded, but didn’t?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gbjcs5bq82a3nhg77naxpg36)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nWherever you can (while allowing for deadlines), prioritise the hardest tasks. It might be the opposite of what you want to do – it’s so satisfying powering through all the easy and enjoyable tasks to give us a false sense of accomplishment. But by chipping away at the hard and unpleasant ones first, you’ll get a greater sense of satisfaction in the long term and boost your spirits and self-confidence. This also leaves the nice things to do at the end of the day when your energy levels are probably lagging, and the last thing you want to do is face a horrible task. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gbjcvw4dfee864q9vk55dghv)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nThe waiting-on list is for those tasks that are important to you but that someone else must do. Keep a log of such tasks as soon as you’ve delegated them, or if someone has volunteered to do it. This technique is further strengthened if you log the dates that the task was assigned and its agreed deadline. Avoid creating more admin for yourself by being picky about what is on your waiting-on list (not more than a dozen). A lighter version is to tag all actions for others with ‘WO’ so it is logged, and you can circle back and chase up periodically.

When display scaling is used, the menu bar changes height to ensure it always fits the camera housing. On a 14-inch MacBook Pro the menu bar can be 27pt, 29pt, 34pt, 37pt, or 43pt tall, depending on the display scaling setting. \n\n---\n\nDespite the variation in possible menu bar heights, the working area for menu bar extras is fixed at 22pt, and items can not be taller. A good size for a circular item to feel the same weight as system menu bar items is 16×16pt. Assets can be a different size, provided they’re not taller than 22pt. There should typically not be any padding, unless it is needed to assist with vertical centering. \n\n---\n\nMenu bar extras can be full colour, or monochrome template images. A template image is a standard image, but macOS will ignore the colour, and only use the alpha channel information. Template images are preferred, because they’re automatically tinted to match the system icons in light mode and dark mode, without the need for different assets. \n\n---\n\nApple typically uses 35% opacity to indicate disabled elements. \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:29.122032518-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Determining-Priority-GTD-Style":{"title":"Determining Priority GTD Style","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article4.6bc1851654a0.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *gettingthingsdone.com*\n* Full Title: Determining Priority GTD Style\n* Category:\n* URL: https://gettingthingsdone.com/2008/08/determining-priority-gtd-style/\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nAs I’ll discuss further in an upcoming post, our brains just aren’t good at carrying around that kind information, or more accurately, they aren’t good at retrieving it when we want it.

And it's exactly the way that we and I try and solve problems that jim shakin in life. So I found that book massively inspiring. And then moving around Youtube, I love your channel. You introduced me to notion notion life like genuinely life changing. We I mean we've run almost everything on notion now. Don't wait from a creative point in the entire the entire business by the way, not just as a person. I run. I think you you coined it like a life. Os I have my life O. S. I have a professional life. Different jim shark stuff. Everything from the notion. So that was a life changing to thank you for that. You're very welcome. Yeah, that's it. I just all around the internet Jordan Peterson, I love jane Peterson, a massive, massive fan of him. I think he's brilliant. He's really helped me as well. ([Time 1:32:57](https://www.airr.io/quote/615efa99cceec3ea04acc1c5))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: jane Peterson, a massive, massive fan of him. I think he's brilliant. He's really helped me as well. \nSpeaker 1: I'd love to check out your notion. Set up behind \nSpeaker 0: scenes. That's one of the things that as we're driving out. Yeah, it's \nSpeaker 1: really cool. That \nSpeaker 0: would be, it would be pretty \nSpeaker 1: sick. Um Cool. And any sort of, let's say someone's watching this and they're thinking they're they want to get started being an entrepreneur. Maybe they're sort of Late teens, early 20s haven't really started anything yet, but really inspired by you and your journey. Any kind of \nSpeaker 0: advice you give? Yeah, I mean it's fairly standard, right? You have to do what you love because otherwise you'll end up, you'll end up giving up. I'm a firm believer now that there's no niche too small, especially with the internet being so vast, I always think, and it sounds stupid saying it now, if I'd have said ([Time 1:33:37](https://www.airr.io/quote/615efac0cceec3ea04acddec))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: just think there's no need to small. So I think whatever it is double down on it and just genuinely give it a go. Like, Jim Sharp was the seventh business website product that I've made and the other six failed miserably now. Unfortunately, that's not a sexy story. So no one talks about the failed apps, the failed websites, they only talk about the one that did well and it's a consistent theme on everyone else that successful that I've met. They failed miserably so many times and they've been endlessly optimistic about it and they've just gone again and again and again. \nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think that's one of the things that, like, I, I see this a lot with people starting YouTube channels where there's this sense of, I have to get it right first time. Yeah. And if you look at the stats, like the average YouTube channel takes 152 videos to get to 1000 subscribers. I get messages from people being like, you know, like ([Time 1:34:37](https://www.airr.io/quote/615efafccceec3ea04ad1a1d))\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.838097291-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/E6-the-Science-Behind-Career-Success-Grace-Lordan":{"title":"E6 the Science Behind Career Success  Grace Lordan","content":"\n# E6 the Science Behind Career Success | Grace Lordan\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/24367/full_1632384816-artwork.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Deep Dive with Ali Abdaal*\n* Full Title: E6 the Science Behind Career Success | Grace Lordan\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/617f7959906dc8000f63c118\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: it's really getting down to the nitty gritty of how can we alter decision making in a way that's not paternalistic but is giving people information to help them go in the right direction. \nSpeaker 1: Okay, yeah, the intent to action gap, I think we've all felt that in our lives like multiple times a day as I was reading this, I started listening to a book about four or five days ago and the very first chapter talks about this idea of me plus I wonder if you can elaborate like what does, what does me plus mean? \nSpeaker 0: So if you, if you go back to the economics were really good, I think making helping ourselves in the present day. So we know what makes us happy in the moment, but very often the things that we have to invest in to give our future selves a better future, we don't often do. So what I like people to do is to think ([Time 0:05:18](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e065d99280c589ea780f28)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: what will that mean plus actually do. Because I've noticed a lot of times when I talk to people about careers, they're attached to a label. So they want to be a trade or an investment banker or they want to be a doctor or they're attached to a lifestyle. So they want to be able to go on a particular vacation or by a particular car and the kind of thing big journey is really thinking about. If I were to be a doctor, if I were to be a trader, what would be the tasks that I would be doing on a day to day basis and would ultimately end up enjoying those tasks? So the activities that I'm going to spend the time in, and there's two reasons for that, so one, it makes you happier to actually do tasks that you like, which feels like a no brainer, but secondly, if you're engaged in tasks that you like, you tend to be more successful and it's the second that I'm really interested in and kind of getting people into jobs where they feel that they've ([Time 0:06:15](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e066099280c589ea781759)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm working for a company that's saving the environment, but I've been treated really badly in a micro culture in order to save that environment. There's a couple of companies come to mind when I think about that um then I'm not going to be productive and I'm not going to be happy and I'm actually likely to leave that that that job. So it's more about going beyond thinking what is the company's mission? What is my personality and what is the micro culture of the team that I'm going to be working in? And will that make me happy? Will I be connected to the mission? Because my team is connected to the mission. \nSpeaker 1: It's very hard to assess in advance when you're applying for a job. \nSpeaker 0: It's really hard. It's really, really hard. And I think that if you bring it down to the tasks and asking in an interview what will I be doing on a day to day basis? Um So when I come to work for you, Ollie, what would I be doing on a day ([Time 0:07:51](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e066689280c589ea78220d)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: the company's mission?

And I think that if you bring it down to the tasks and asking in an interview what will I be doing on a day to day basis? Um So when I come to work for you, Ollie, what would I be doing on a day to day basis? As part of your team? If you can imagine me on a monday, how will I spend my time, the fact that you as a manager have talked about that first, they will tell me that you're a good manager because you know actually what you want the person to do. Um And you're not just hiring blindly? But the second is having that information allows me make my mind up because if the if I like the ([Time 0:08:09](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e0667b9280c589ea7823e2)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: I was excited that the end goal was not 66 pack abs. I was excited that the end goal was that in a way there wasn't an end goal and it was a case of just I want to be able to enjoy this. Um, is that the sort of thing that you get a lot when you're doing this sort of research that process rather than outcome kind of thing. \nSpeaker 0: So I kind of write a lot for kind of people who might have made it yet or people who have plateau. So if you, if you take the exercising analogy from somebody who's contemplating doing the kind of five K run rather than somebody who is contemplating doing the London marathon and it's really well placed for that. And I think for the person who hasn't done exercise for a while or the person who has really invested in their career for a while, the worst thing they can do is do too much. So if you haven't invested for a while, the worst thing you could do is go to the gym for three hours, you might get through it today. But the chances of ([Time 0:09:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e066cf9280c589ea782fbc)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: kind of write a lot for kind of people who might have made it yet or people who have plateau.

So if you haven't invested for a while, the worst thing you could do is go to the gym for three hours, you might get through it today. But the chances of repeating that are really, really small. And I think kind of the, one of the big powerful messages underlining thing, big is whether you're focused on your health or whether you're focused on your career, it's those small actions that you take today will determine yourself in two years time, three years time in four years time and actually by throwing ([Time 0:09:49](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e066de9280c589ea783227)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: and the vibe I got from the chapter around goals is that you're keen on people setting or uh, perhaps not, but like one camp of people in this sphere is encouraging people to set these big, hairy, audacious goals and then figuring out the small steps taken you can, you can take to get there. But then there's another camp and this is sort of where I think I am whereby I think in a way, I feel maybe setting goals is a bit overrated because if you're setting a goal, then \nSpeaker 0: you're \nSpeaker 1: essentially, to me that feels like a contract to be unhappy until you hit the goal and then you hit the goal and then you have this like, fleeting sense of like, oh, I hit a million subscribers, cool, you know, my day to day hasn't really changed, etcetera etcetera. So the way I kind of think ([Time 0:12:20](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e067769280c589ea784a7a)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: of think with the future of work, we have this disruption where people who are able to kind of pivot, know what their skills are job craft, which you, which you've mentioned already. It will really stand to them. \nSpeaker 1: Mm Yeah. So it's like you're moving away from being and more towards doing being a doctor. But versus like what does the day to day of practicing medicine actually look like? And does this sound like the sort of thing that is my idea of fun right now? And I guess, I guess like it's it's kind of, you know, there's that thing in in in the research about it's it's hard for us to predict what will make us happy in the future. \nSpeaker 0: But it's a \nSpeaker 1: reasonable first approximation that the sort of stuff I enjoy doing now, like talking to people like you or like making videos is likely to also probably make me happy in the future. And if it doesn't, then, well, I can just change course, this \nSpeaker 0: is like a grid search. So ([Time 0:16:58](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e0699d9280c589ea789020)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: which one to pick, but like yeah, \nSpeaker 0: so I think for somebody who has no idea what they want to do and who doesn't necessarily have options. It really is about bringing it back to one of the activities that I would like to do and how can I get the skills to actually do those activities and then going about spending time engaged in those activities, So maybe you want to do some more public speaking, you know, trying to get on panels, um trying to spend some time with people who might be actually able to get you into the room where you can do some public speaking in the future, going to talks and studying what Mexico speaker and what doesn't make a good speaker, if you really, really have really have no experience and then maybe there are some skills that you have to pay for and I do say and think big for people who do not know what they want to do, I would avoid committing to a four year degree or an expensive master's program and really use the resources that ([Time 0:20:06](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e06a2d9280c589ea78a6d9)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: about spending time engaged in those activities, So maybe you want to do some more public speaking, you know, trying to get on panels, um trying to spend some time with people who might be actually able to get you into the room where you can do some public speaking in the future, going to talks and studying what Mexico speaker and what doesn't make a good speaker, if you really, really have really have no experience and then maybe there are some skills that you have to pay for and I do say and think big for people who do not know what they want to do, I would avoid committing to a four year degree or an expensive master's program and really use the resources that are out there that are either cheap or free because there's so many things that we can actually learn now without having set foot into a traditional classroom, even though I work in a university and we have wonderful degrees, I think you need to be certain to spend, spend that amount of money and then I think for someone like ([Time 0:20:21](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e06a3b9280c589ea78a9db)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: then maybe there are some skills that you have to pay for and I do say and think big for people who do not know what they want to do, I would avoid committing to a four year degree or an expensive master's program and really use the resources that are out there that are either cheap or free because there's so many things that we can actually learn now without having set foot into a traditional classroom, even though I work in a university and we have wonderful degrees, I think you need to be certain to spend, spend that amount of money and then I think for someone like you, I think doing time orders can really help. So during the week writing down what you're actually doing, which you probably do already, but writing down whether or not you actually enjoy doing them, Did you feel firstly a sense of purpose that it was kind of leading you to a better place in five years time or did you feel fun in the moment and then if there were activities that ([Time 0:20:40](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e06a4e9280c589ea78b8c0)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: are either cheap or free because there's so many things that we can actually learn now without having set foot into a traditional classroom, even though I work in a university and we have wonderful degrees, I think you need to be certain to spend, spend that amount of money and then I think for someone like you, I think doing time orders can really help.

So if you look at the behavioral science literature, a lot of the kind of early ideas will be from bringing students into the lab. It's not scary, like in the 70s, I promise. So, you know, really easy stuff and looking to see whether or not we can change their behavior with a particular insight and then somebody like me brings those insights into companies Into policy and asks is the stuff that's coming out of the students in the lab actually replicating in companies and a lot of times it does. And I would be very honest with you because obviously when we have students in the lab, we have them for a very short period of time when I'm working with workers, I want to know, do the change I make work in the moment one week later, one month later, 12 months later. And because of that methods are really ([Time 0:30:35](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e06df29280c589ea798c70)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: of purpose to in order to make myself feel better now um and again, once you're moving forward and once you're walking, I think that that's that's good, that's good enough for most people. Okay. \nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think like there's there's a lot of evidence as you know about how experiencing progress and I think you talk about how to like make your progress more salient, experiencing that sense of progress really is like extremely fundamentally satisfying. Uh And so I guess sometimes if, I think, you know, I guess the standard straw man would be like, oh well you know, if you just play video games all day then it's fun, but it's not like meaningful and I think it's not meaningful because it's not really progressing you forward in a way that adds value to the world, Is that fair to say \nSpeaker 0: or to ([Time 0:36:47](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e2ff00e8cddee92c2e5496)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: that adds value to the world, Is that fair to say \nSpeaker 0: or to yourself? So you know, some people who I meet their values are really about making making money, which is which doesn't bother me. Um but I think that they need to be clear on what the task that they're going to do, that add value to the world. I think I think that I think that's really true and I think finding the kind of right balance of pleasure and purpose is really important, you should play video games if that's something that actually really helps you relax. I think for some people it's been shown that it can be like mindfulness. So again, really thinking about individual differences if playing Mario Kart is what gets you kind of out of the day and into the moment you should spend time on that, but it's balancing that time, so balance the time between serving yourself in the present day and also serving yourself in the future. \nSpeaker 1: And I guess most people's dream job would be one ([Time 0:37:28](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e2ff29e8cddee92c2e5ab3)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: it can be like mindfulness. So again, really thinking about individual differences if playing Mario Kart is what gets you kind of out of the day and into the moment you should spend time on that, but it's balancing that time, so balance the time between serving yourself in the present day and also serving yourself in the future. \nSpeaker 1: And I guess most people's dream job would be one where they've got pleasure plus purpose in the same thing and that would be great. Um but if not then something pleasurable and some things are purposeful and just balancing those is that is that fair to say? \nSpeaker 0: Absolutely, Absolutely. And I think as well the kind of adaptation that we feel as humans, it's called hedonic adaptation, Everything that you get you adapt to it really quickly. So whether you get the nicest car, whether you get a pay rise, you know the happiness moments are really fleeting, so if you really are kind of in a place and you feel that things aren't going ([Time 0:37:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e2ff49e8cddee92c2e5f39)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: in the future. \nSpeaker 1: And I guess most people's dream job would be one where they've got pleasure plus purpose in the same thing and that would be great. Um but if not then something pleasurable and some things are purposeful and just balancing those is that is that fair to say? \nSpeaker 0: Absolutely, Absolutely. And I think as well the kind of adaptation that we feel as humans, it's called hedonic adaptation, Everything that you get you adapt to it really quickly. So whether you get the nicest car, whether you get a pay rise, you know the happiness moments are really fleeting, so if you really are kind of in a place and you feel that things aren't going your way trying to draw attention to things that are going right kind of the small winds so that you can kind of elongate the happiness that you will actually get from the car from the pay rise. But also look at those kind of small moments, you know, if you have an interaction today with ([Time 0:38:09](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e2ff53e8cddee92c2e60d9)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: is that is that fair to say? \nSpeaker 0: Absolutely, Absolutely. And I think as well the kind of adaptation that we feel as humans, it's called hedonic adaptation, Everything that you get you adapt to it really quickly. So whether you get the nicest car, whether you get a pay rise, you know the happiness moments are really fleeting, so if you really are kind of in a place and you feel that things aren't going your way trying to draw attention to things that are going right kind of the small winds so that you can kind of elongate the happiness that you will actually get from the car from the pay rise. But also look at those kind of small moments, you know, if you have an interaction today with somebody and they insult you, it would probably weigh really heavy on you, whereas if somebody gives you a huge compliment, how long do you hold on to that? Which is a really interesting thing for us as humans right? That we were focused on the negative we're ([Time 0:38:21](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e2ff61e8cddee92c2e635a)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: and they try to move forward in a way, so try to find a side or try to find another entrance and then these people with an external locus of control who believe that everything happens to them. So it's at the hands of other people, um it's at the hands of the universe in the extreme, most of us will have both. Internal, external looks control depending on our domain. So maybe in family life, some people will have internal locus of control. They believe that they can control everything, they feel quite safe in their family life, in the work life, they think their career is happening to them. And I think again, it isn't all or nothing. So getting people to think about what is it that I can actually control in this particular moment and taking the choice to take that control. So, I think even for people who are having a really terrible time in toxic ([Time 0:41:07](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e30005e8cddee92c2e7ab0)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: seeing the bad things that are happening to them with the idea that they can get out of that situation. \nSpeaker 1: Mm How do people end up with internal slash external local? Okay, \nSpeaker 0: we don't know. So this this will come down in the same way like genetics. So, you would have people who believe in nature and people who believe in nurture and I think the reality is that it's probably a combination of both. So our genetics probably give us some proportion of our locus of control when we're born, depending on the kind of experiences that our ancestors have had. But I think the biggest thing is going to be the environment that you actually grew up in. So I think if you put in an environment where you're encouraged to make decisions when you're really young, you're encouraged to kind of choose your own path, choose your own toys in the play box, for example, that's going to allow you think ([Time 0:42:03](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e3003de8cddee92c2e829d)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: in that particular situation? What could I have done differently? What was my input and what was down to luck? And in luck, I would put anything that's determined outside yourself by other by other people. And then it's really about identifying those things that you can control and taking hold of them and not over obsessing on the stuff that is outside you're outside your control. So in some ways it's kind of taking the best of the internal locus of control, recognizing that luck does play a role in determining these outcomes of success and failure. And people who do these postmortems really juicy learning and failure, but they don't dwell on failure. Um so if they have a face, if they fail on a particular moment, they're sitting down saying what could I have done differently and then for the future they're taking those lessons on board. Yeah. Speaking \nSpeaker 1: of failure. So ([Time 0:44:40](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e3153ce8cddee92c316ca7)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: a role in determining these outcomes of success and failure. And people who do these postmortems really juicy learning and failure, but they don't dwell on failure. Um so if they have a face, if they fail on a particular moment, they're sitting down saying what could I have done differently and then for the future they're taking those lessons on board. Yeah. Speaking \nSpeaker 1: of failure. So you're talking that chapter about anticipating failure and how often that hold hold people back. I wonder if you can talk like, what does that mean to anticipate failure? \nSpeaker 0: Yes. I mean, the anticipation of an event brings on anxieties that can be worse than actually experiencing an event itself. So very often if you talk to people who report having anxieties or who report having worries, They're talking about something that might actually happen in the future one than something that they're going through in a particular ([Time 0:45:06](https://www.airr.io/quote/62e31555e8cddee92c3170a8)) #status/review \n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: on this? \nSpeaker 0: Well, that's a great one. So lowering the cost of actually doing things, you could liken it when you're, you're somebody who doesn't like running, putting your running shoes and your gear out in the, in the nights that you actually slip them on. What you describe, the really reminds me of the Pomodoro technique that has been shown to work really well from across the nature is so the idea that you don't plan to work for the day, you just show up for 20 minutes. Um and there's something about our brain not wanting to have something that hasn't closed the loop that will keep us working. The Pomodoro technique says you work for 20 minutes and regardless of if you're in flow, you take a five minute break and when you take that five minute break, you will start worrying and giggling and really wanting to actually go back to the task. So the sheer act of showing up for those 1st 20 minutes will get you on the path that you \nSpeaker 1: described.

Each hour or week or year is like a container being carried on the belt, which we must fill as it passes, if we’re to feel that we’re making good use of our time. When there are too many activities to fit comfortably into the containers, we feel unpleasantly busy; when there are too few, we feel bored. If we keep pace with the passing containers, we congratulate ourselves for “staying on top of things” and feel like we’re justifying our existence; if we let too many pass by unfilled, we feel we’ve wasted them. If we use containers labeled “work time” for the purposes of leisure, our employer may grow irritated.

Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time—instead of just being time, you might say—it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal, or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally “out of the way.” ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B08FGV64B1\u0026location=282))\n\n---\n\nThe universal truth behind my specific issues is that most of us invest a lot of energy, one way or another, in trying to avoid fully experiencing the reality in which we find ourselves. We don’t want to feel the anxiety that might arise if we were to ask ourselves whether we’re on the right path, or what ideas about ourselves it could be time to give up. We don’t want to risk getting hurt in relationships or failing professionally; we don’t want to accept that we might never succeed in pleasing our parents or in changing certain things we don’t like about ourselves—and we certainly don’t want to get sick and die. The details differ from person to person, but the kernel is the same. We recoil from the notion that this is it—that this life, with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it unfolds, is the only one we’ll get a shot at.

And so, instead, like the dutiful and efficient worker I was, I’d put my energy into clearing the decks, cranking through the smaller stuff to get it out of the way—only to discover that doing so took the whole day, that the decks filled up again overnight anyway, and that the moment for responding to the New Delhi email or for researching the milestone article never arrived.

Perhaps the most appealing way to resist the truth about your finite time is to initiate a large number of projects at once; that way, you get to feel as though you’re keeping plenty of irons in the fire and making progress on all fronts. Instead, what usually ends up happening is that you make progress on no fronts—because each time a project starts to feel difficult, or frightening, or boring, you can bounce off to a different one instead. You get to preserve your sense of being in control of things, but at the cost of never finishing anything important. The alternative approach is to fix a hard upper limit on the number of things that you allow yourself to work on at any given time. In their book Personal Kanban, which explores this strategy in detail, the management experts Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry suggest no more than three items.

Now it became the intuitive thing to do: it was clear that if I nominated “write book” or “move house” as one of my three tasks in progress, it would clog up the system for months, so I was naturally motivated to figure out the next achievable step in each case instead. Rather than trying to do everything, I found it easier to accept the truth that I’d be doing only a few things on any given day. The difference, this time, was that I actually did them.

As soon as I start trying to live any of those lives, though, I’ll be forced to make trade-offs—to put less time than I’d like into one of those domains, so as to make space for another—and to accept that nothing I do will go perfectly anyway, with the result that my actual life will inevitably prove disappointing by comparison with the fantasy.

The finest meal at a Michelin-starred restaurant might as well be a plate of instant noodles if your mind is elsewhere; and a friendship to which you never actually give a moment’s thought is a friendship in name only. “Attention is the beginning of devotion,” writes the poet Mary Oliver, pointing to the fact that distraction and care are incompatible with each other: you can’t truly love a partner or a child, dedicate yourself to a career or to a cause—or just savor the pleasure of a stroll in the park—except to the extent that you can hold your attention on the object of your devotion to begin with.

As you surface from an hour inadvertently frittered away on Facebook, you’d be forgiven for assuming that the damage, in terms of wasted time, was limited to that single misspent hour. But you’d be wrong. Because the attention economy is designed to prioritize whatever’s most compelling—instead of whatever’s most true, or most useful—it systematically distorts the picture of the world we carry in our heads at all times. It influences our sense of what matters, what kinds of threats we face, how venal our political opponents are, and thousands of other things—and all these distorted judgments then influence how we allocate our offline time as well.

The truth is addictive.   In contrast, if you refuse to lose a debate, your brain keeps running old firmware.   (I realized this after comparing humble versus tribalist people arguing on Twitter. Personally, to be comfortable being wrong, I needed to appreciate that being occasionally wrong doesn't make me look dumb to people I admire.

And good friends don't care either way.)\n*Learn to enjoy being proven wrong*\n\n---\n\n[Coaching](../Coaching.md) is not the same thing as giving advice. Coaching is strategic advice giving. It's about helping people improve their thinking—not solving problems for them. Don't hand them your answers wrapped in a question, e.g. don't say \"Have you thought about doing...\" That's not strategic. Instead, ask questions to guide them there.  One way to start is by asking them two questions: \"How can I support you?\" → Forces them to think through how to best use your time and theirs. \"What do you ultimately want?\" → Forces them to think through which obstacle matters most. Focus on that. Do not tackle everything at once.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.703612772-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Highlights-Three-New-Books-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail":{"title":"Highlights Three New Books 🍌 - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail","content":"\nHighlights: Three New Books 🍌 - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article4.6bc1851654a0.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Create account*\n* Full Title: Highlights: Three New Books 🍌 - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n* URL: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzGpFqbtcqHMkRGgRWQVlZqGkgjx\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nBloggers who post frequently (say, twice weekly) are rarely worth reading consistently.   I read for insights.

When you are in a conversation, listening to a lecture, hear something noteworthy or an idea pops into your mind while you are running errands, a quick note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of doing. That might even apply to reading, if you want to focus on a text without interrupting your reading flow. Then you might want to just underline sentences or write short comments in the margins. It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text.

A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal. In the first case, you forgot what it was supposed to remind you of. In the second case, you forgot the context that gave it its meaning.

But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information.

In a small but fascinating study, two psychologists tried to find out if it made a difference if students in a lecture took notes by hand or by typing them into their laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). They were not able to find any difference in terms of the number of facts the students were able to remember.

([Location 2130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2130))\n\n---\n\nHe advocates looking out for the most powerful concepts in every discipline and to try to understand them so thoroughly that they become part of our thinking.

This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience. ([Location 2174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2174))\n\n---\n\nBut we can make it a habit to always ask what is not in the picture, but could be relevant.

We are restricted to the use of only 26 letters, but what that enables us to do! We can write novels, theories, love letters or court orders – just by rearranging these 26 letters. This is certainly not possible despite the restriction to 26 letters, but because of it. Nobody will open a book and wish it contains more types of letters or be disappointed because it is, again, just another variation of the same alphabet. ([Location 2393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2393))\n- Note: But this is also why language evolves because we have a limited set of letters and words. Would this repurposing of words still happen with more letters available to us?\n\n---\n\nJust look into your slip-box and see where clusters have been built up. These clusters are what caught your interest again and again, so you already know that you have found material to work with. Now you can spread out these notes on your desktop or use the outliner of the Zettelkasten, outline your argument and construct a preliminary order of sections, chapters or paragraphs. This will make questions, which are not answered, obvious, and it will show the gaps in the argument that need to be filled and make visible which parts still need some work.

([Location 2490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2490))\n- Note: Early into a specific field we feel we are doing innovative things that are not novel or new. As we spend more time with a field we feel like we are being less innovative, but are actually being more innovative. [We are poor judges of how innovative our ideas are](../seedlings/We%20are%20poor%20judges%20of%20how%20innovative%20our%20ideas%20are.md). This is another form of the [Curse of Knowledge](../Curse%20of%20Knowledge.md).\n\n---\n\nNothing motivates us more than seeing a project we can identify with moving forward, and nothing is more demotivating than being stuck with a project that doesn’t seem to be worth doing.

Slavoj Žižek said in an interview\\[41\\] that he wouldn’t be able to write a single sentence if he didn’t start by convincing himself he was only writing down some ideas for himself, and that maybe he could turn it into something publishable later. By the time he stopped writing, he was always surprised to find that the only thing left to do was revise the draft he already had. ([Location 2643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B06WVYW33Y\u0026location=2643))\n- Note: Just get started.

Also why recurring meetings should have agendas.\n\n---\n\nThe goal here is to get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects. If we manage to establish a routine in this first step, it becomes much easier to develop the urge to turn these findings into permanent notes and connect them with other notes in the slip-box.

I wanted to feel like she saw, understood, and shared in my excitement. I wasn’t telling her the story because I liked talking; I was sharing it with her in the hope that she would see my excitement and get excited with me. I was hoping we would connect over the shared experience.

This is why watching a movie with someone else is so much more rewarding than watching it by yourself.\n\n---\n\nThus, the core idea of this book is that, in order to become a “great listener,” you actually need to become a great validator. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=279))\n\n---\n\nWhile they were exposed to the same stressors as the other group, those who had their feelings validated found it significantly easier to regulate their emotions and keep their cool. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=386))\n- Note: We did a good job at employing this at the Valley go live.\n\n---\n\nMore often than not, people who vent or complain already know how to handle their current situation—they’re just looking for someone to see and appreciate their struggle. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=388))\n\n---\n\nThere are, of course, countless ways to validate. As long as you show the other person that you recognize and accept their emotions, you’re validating. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=393))\n\n---\n\nThe truth is there’s nothing inherently good or bad about any emotion. Emotions just are. They’re simply reactions to a situation. And, whether we like it or not, we’re going to feel a whole slew of them, each and every day, for the rest of our lives. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=420))\n\n---\n\nWhen someone is in that state, a simple “don’t worry” doesn’t help. If you instead show them that you see and appreciate what they’re feeling, they’ll either find a solution of their own, or become much more willing to listen to yours.

([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=552))\n\n---\n\nValidation has two main elements. It 1) acknowledges a specific emotion, and 2) offers justification for feeling that emotion. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=662))\n\n---\n\nValidation is nonjudgmental.

Doing so helps others let go of difficult emotions much more quickly, often allowing them to find a solution to the problem on their own. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=670))\n\n---\n\nIf someone is distraught, angry, or concerned, validating them is your best chance at getting them to be receptive to feedback. The great thing is, you can validate someone even if you disagree with them. Learning to do so will give you a valuable tool for navigating confrontations, negotiations, disagreements, and the like. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B071K4MWMK\u0026location=777))\n\n---\n\nEffective validation requires empathy and emotional understanding, and therefore extends beyond simple reflective listening.

So the on leeway to find that out is to constantly be out putting as much as you can as diverse a range of thoughts and ideas, and then see which ones really resonate with people. And almost always, I can tell you this, it's gonna be the one you least expect. It's gonna be the one you take for granted, the one that you think, Oh, doesn't everyone know this isn't this, like, obvious, and it's obvious to you. That's why it's so powerful.

In these 90% are things you pick up in conversations, only to forget by the next minute.

So like, if you're submitting your website or you're only fans to product hunt the hacker news to read it, it's a huge hit or miss it. Either lands and it's the front page and goes viral or kind of dies in the abyss, but on twitter, if you just keep chipping away, you're going to get incrementally more followers. And if you put the hours in like I just went from 14,000 to 80,000 followers in about five months because I just sat there reverse engineered like what are the best tweets have in common and just leaned into it.

If you have all these examples of what's called them creators who eventually make much more money by converting that potential energy into startup equity, essentially, then on your way to becoming huge, maybe don't slow yourself down. So if you're paywall paywall in all your assets and your cutting off your viral potential on the way to getting that big, but you can convert that social capital to start up capital, then you're slowing your ability to actually win, you're not going to hit the global maximum, how much money you can make.

Now I know how to put my texture on this because I've learned the combination of what the people I like do and I'm gonna make a little bit of my own and my own flair to that.

They have all identified what they want to spend their time on, and they work at it every day, no matter what. Whether their latest thing is universally rejected, ignored, or acclaimed, they know they’ll still get up tomorrow and do their work.

Where are the free spaces in your schedule? What could you cut out of your day to make time? Are you an early riser or a night owl? (I’ve met very few people who love working in the afternoon. “I detest this mongrel time, neither day nor night,” wrote Charles Dickens.) Are there silly rituals or superstitions that get you in a creative mood? (I’m writing these words with a pencil, painted to look like a cigarette, dangling from my lips.)

Rather than restricting your freedom, a routine gives you freedom by protecting you from the ups and downs of life and helping you take advantage of your limited time, energy, and talent. A routine establishes good habits that can lead to your best work.

There’s nothing like a good prison break, and playing hooky isn’t as fun if you never go to school. What your daily routine consists of is not that important. What’s important is that the routine exists. Cobble together your own routine, stick to it most days, break from it once in a while for fun, and modify it as necessary.

The best thing about tidying is that it busies my hands and loosens up my mind so that I either a) get unstuck or solve a new problem in my head, or b) come across something in the mess that leads to new work.

But in many cases this is exactly the wrong approach. In the sole U.S. presidential debate in 1980 between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, Reagan could have cited innumerable statistics demonstrating the sluggishness of the economy. Instead, he asked a simple question that allowed voters to test for themselves: “Before you vote, ask yourself if you are better off today than you were four years ago.” ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B000N2HCKQ\u0026location=266))\n\n---\n\nHow do we get people to act on our ideas? We tell stories. Firefighters naturally swap stories after every fire, and by doing so they multiply their experience; after years of hearing stories, they have a richer, more complete mental catalog of critical situations they might confront during a fire and the appropriate responses to those situations. Research shows that mentally rehearsing a situation helps us perform better when we encounter that situation in the physical environment.

The planning process forces people to think through the right issues. But as for the plans themselves, Kolditz says, “They just don’t work on the battlefield.” So, in the 1980s the Army adapted its planning process, inventing a concept called Commander’s Intent (CI).

Pretty sobering stuff. It’s also pretty abstract. You probably walk away from these stats thinking something like “There’s a lot of dissatisfaction and confusion in most companies.” Then Covey superimposes a very human metaphor over the statistics. He says, “If, say, a soccer team had these same scores, only 4 of the 11 players on the field would know which goal is theirs. Only 2 of the 11 would care. Only 2 of the 11 would know what position they play and know exactly what they are supposed to do. And all but 2 players would, in some way, be competing against their own team members rather than the opponent.” The soccer analogy generates a human context for the statistics. It creates a sense of drama and a sense of movement. We can’t help but imagine the actions of the two players trying to score a goal, being opposed at every stage by the rest of their team. Why does the analogy work? It relies on our schema of soccer teams and the fact that this schema is somehow cleaner, more well-defined, than our schemas of organizations. It’s more vivid to think of a lack of cooperation on a soccer team—where teamwork is paramount—than in a corporation.

It works because we can’t imagine events or sequences without evoking the same modules of the brain that are evoked in real physical activity. Brain scans show that when people imagine a flashing light, they activate the visual area of the brain; when they imagine someone tapping on their skin, they activate tactile areas of the brain. The activity of mental simulation is not limited to the insides of our heads. People who imagine words that start with b or p can’t resist subtle lip movements, and people who imagine looking at the Eiffel Tower can’t resist moving their eyes upward. Mental simulation can even alter visceral physical responses: When people drink water but imagine that it’s lemon juice, they salivate more.

The takeaway is simple: Mental simulation is not as good as actually doing something, but it’s the next best thing.

Denning says that the idea of telling stories initially violated his intuition. He had always believed in the value of being direct, and he worried that stories were too ambiguous, too peripheral, too anecdotal. He thought, “Why not spell out the message directly? Why go to the trouble and difficulty of trying to elicit the listener’s thinking indirectly, when it would be so much simpler if I come straight out in an abstract directive? Why not hit the listeners between the eyes?” The problem is that when you hit listeners between the eyes they respond by fighting back. The way you deliver a message to them is a cue to how they should react.

In Chapter 1 (“Simple”), we discussed the importance of focusing on core messages—honing in on the most important truths that we need to communicate. If the world takes our ideas and changes them—or accepts some and discards others—all we need to decide is whether the mutated versions are still core. If they are—as with “It’s the economy, stupid”—then we should humbly embrace the audience’s judgment. Ultimately, the test of our success as idea creators isn’t whether people mimic our exact words, it’s whether we achieve our goals.

And often we're producing results with much less effort. And the difference I think is *leverage*. We talked a lot about leverage in our in our work either day by day, you're building some sort of leverage and you can think of leverage as power, some source of power, some source of um of influence that is increasing with time, you can think of, you know, an investing account that you're putting money into every month as a form of leverage over time that's going to get more and more powerful. A blog That you regularly published two as a form of leverage every post. You add ads not one post of value but adds kind of *exponential value*.

You \nSpeaker 0: know, what's crazy, what second brain did for me transcends all of this. What it did was it made me treat my future self as if that person was real and it didn't just have an impact with my ideas. It had an impact on the way I eat the quality of my sleep, my fitness routines. Because for the first time in my life, I was actually creating something for future David. And I was thinking, what will 30 year old David, what will 40 year old, 50, 60, 70 year old David want? And normally it's called the End of history illusion. You think that the person that you are now is the person that you're always going to be. But when you have the second brain, you're always thinking about what your future self is gonna want and it becomes this radical shift in your own identity, treating who you're going to be in the future as somebody worth considering, like a wife, like a sister, \nSpeaker 1: like a mother. \nSpeaker 0: And when that happens, you're able to act with more direction, more diligence and live a healthier ([Time 0:03:18](https://www.airr.io/quote/613cf7edf83bbd000e9e3c7d))\n([Time 0:02:36](https://www.airr.io/quote/613cf7ede4da52000f2c76cb))\n\n## *Invest in your Future Self*\n\nSpeaker 0: more direction, more diligence and live a healthier life, \nSpeaker 1: I think so. And here's the trick though, that makes doing this with ideas so powerful usually. I mean, what we're talking about here is *delayed gratification*. Usually it's a trade off. I can favor myself now or I can favor myself in the future with finances. You think I can spend the money now, I can spend the money later, that you can't really spend it both times, but with ideas you can. So what I notice is when I write something down, I get a benefit in that instant, I get the benefit of seeing my idea in a concrete form. I get the benefit of having it, not on my mind and not having to keep track of it, I get the benefit of sharing it with someone else.

Each sprint day, we drew attention to one big focal point: On Monday, the team creates a map of the problem; on Tuesday, each person sketches one solution; on Wednesday, they decide which solutions are best; on Thursday, they build a prototype; and on Friday, they test it. Each day’s goal is ambitious, but it’s just one thing. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=447))\n\n---\n\nWe also learned about the importance of energy for focused work and clear thinking. When we first started running design sprints, teams worked long hours, fueled by sugary treats. Late in the week, energy would plummet. So we made adjustments, and saw how things like a healthy lunch, a quick walk, frequent breaks, and a slightly shorter workday helped maintain peak energy, resulting in better and more effective work. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=455))\n\n---\n\nThe first step is choosing a single highlight to prioritize in your day. Next, you’ll employ specific tactics to stay laser-focused on that highlight—we’ll offer a menu of tricks to beat distraction in an always-connected world. Throughout the day, you’ll build energy so you can stay in control of your time and attention. Finally, you’ll reflect on the day with a few simple notes. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=500))\n\n---\n\nThe first step in Make Time is deciding what you want to make time for. Every day, you’ll choose a single activity to prioritize and protect in your calendar. It might be an important goal at work, like finishing a presentation. You might choose something at home, like cooking dinner or planting your garden. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=506))\n\n---\n\nAsking yourself “What’s going to be the highlight of my day?” ensures that you spend time on the things that matter to you and don’t lose the entire day reacting to other people’s priorities. When you choose a Highlight, you put yourself in a positive, proactive frame of mind. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=513))\n\n---\n\nFinally, before going to bed, you’ll take a few notes. It’s super simple: You’ll decide which tactics you want to continue and which ones you want to refine or drop.2 And you’ll think back on your energy level, whether you made time for your Highlight, and what brought you joy in the day. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=536))\n\n---\n\nI loved thinking about big, lofty goals and I was good at getting things done hour by hour, but neither was truly satisfying. I was happiest when I had something I could hold on to in the present—a chunk of time that was bigger than a to-do but smaller than a five-year goal. An activity I could plan for, look forward to, and appreciate when it was done. In other words, I needed to make sure every day had a highlight. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=645))\n\n---\n\nYour Highlight gives each day a focal point. Research shows that the way you experience your days is not determined primarily by what happens to you. In fact, you create your own reality by choosing what you pay attention to.1 This might seem obvious, but we think it’s a big deal: You can design your time by choosing where you direct your attention. And your daily Highlight is the target of that attention. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=664))\n\n---\n\nThe second Highlight strategy is to think about satisfaction: At the end of the day, which Highlight will bring me the most satisfaction? ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=691))\n\n---\n\nThe third strategy focuses on joy: When I reflect on today, what will bring me the most joy? ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=704))\n\n---\n\nTo other people, some of your joyful Highlights may look like wastes of time: sitting at home reading a book, meeting a friend to play Frisbee in the park, even doing a crossword puzzle. Not to us. You only waste time if you’re not intentional about how you spend it. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=707))\n\n---\n\nA good rule of thumb is to choose a Highlight that takes sixty to ninety minutes. If you spend less than sixty minutes, you might not have time to get in the zone, but after ninety minutes of focused attention, most people need a break. Sixty to ninety minutes is a sweet spot. It’s enough time to do something meaningful, and it’s a reasonable amount of time to create in your schedule. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=717))\n\n---\n\nIf yesterday’s Highlight brought you joy or satisfaction, hey, there’s nothing wrong with more of that! Repeat to keep the good times rolling. You don’t have to reinvent yourself each day. Once you’ve identified something that’s important to you, focusing on it day after day will help it take root in your life, grow, and flourish. Sounds cheesy, but it’s true. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=776))\n\n---\n\nUse daily “do not schedule” blocks to make room for your Highlight. ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=992))\n\n---\n\nCould you squeeze in a new project but worry about giving it the proper attention? “Unfortunately, I don’t have the time to do a great job on this.” ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1045))\n\n---\n\nOur friend Kristen Brillantes uses what she calls the Sour Patch Kid method when she says no. Just like the candy, Kristen’s answers are sour at first but sweet at the end. For example: “Unfortunately, my team won’t be able to participate. But you might ask Team X; they’d be perfect for this kind of event.” The key, says Kristen, is to make sure the sweet ending is authentic, not an empty add-on. If she can, she’ll offer a connection to another person with capacity or interest for whom the invitation might be a cool opportunity. If not, she offers encouragement or gratitude. ([Location 1054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1054))\n\n---\n\nCoffee is also super important to me. Sure, the caffeine is nice, but the preparation routine is essential to my morning. It takes me fifteen minutes to make coffee using a simple pour-over technique: boil water, grind beans, position filter, add grounds, pour water. This process is more labor-intensive than using a machine, but that’s the idea. My slow coffee ritual keeps me occupied during the low-willpower period when I would otherwise check email or look at Twitter, both of which are likely to send me into a reactive vortex of unproductivity. Instead, I stand in the kitchen (or galley), wake up slowly, think about my day, and enjoy a fresh cup of coffee while I settle in to work on my Highlight. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1123))\n\n---\n\nFinally, adjust your environment to wind down and signal “bedtime” to your body. I begin by lowering the lights. I turn off peripheral lights in the kitchen and foyer, then switch to floor lamps in the living room and bedroom. My favorite routine—and dorkiest by far—is a do-it-yourself turn-down service. Around 7 p.m. each night, I close the curtains in the bedroom, remove the decorative pillows from the bed, and pull back the covers. (Check out #84, “Fake the Sunset,” for more.) ([Location 1143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1143))\n\n---\n\nIf I’m planning to stay up and work on a project, I’ll start by refreshing my brain with a real break (#80). After my younger son goes to bed (around 8:30 p.m.), I might sit down with my wife and older son and watch part of a movie. Or I might read a few pages in a novel. Or I might clean the kitchen and put away toys in the living room. These activities take my mind out of “busy mode” and recharge my mental battery—a major difference from the frenzy of checking email, reading clickbait news articles, or watching an intense TV show designed to suck me into a black hole of binge watching.7 ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1176))\n\n---\n\nAround nine-thirty, I’ll switch into Highlight mode, usually for writing but sometimes to prepare a presentation or workshop. Even with a quick battery recharge, my focus is usually not at 100 percent, so I put a vacation timer on the Internet (#28), allowing me to concentrate on my writing with minimal willpower. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1183))\n\n---\n\nI learned the hard way that I have to spin down my brain after late-night work or I’ll seriously mess up my sleep. Dimming the lights (#84) helps, but most important is getting to bed before I turn into a pumpkin. For me, that magic hour is 11:30 p.m., and if I’m not in bed by then, I’ll tank my energy the next day. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1188))\n\n---\n\nWe evolved to be distractible because it kept us safe from danger (check the flash in your peripheral vision—it might be a stalking tiger or a falling tree!). We evolved to love mysteries and stories because they helped us learn and communicate. We evolved to love gossip and seek social status because that allowed us to form tight-knit protective tribes. And we evolved to love unpredictable rewards, whether from a blackberry bush or a smartphone notification, because the possibility of those rewards kept us hunting and gathering even when we returned home empty-handed. Our caveman brains are the fourth secret ingredient. Of course we love email, video games, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat—it’s literally in our DNA. ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1345))\n\n---\n\nThese tactics are all based on the same philosophy: The best way to defeat distraction is to make it harder to react. By adding a few steps that get in the way of checking Facebook, catching up on the news, or turning on the TV, you can short-circuit the cycle that makes these products so sticky. After just a few days, you’ll have a new set of defaults: You’ll go from distracted to focused, from reactive to intentional, and from overwhelmed to in control. ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1373))\n\n---\n\nIf you change your priorities, people will notice. Your actions show others what’s important to you. When your friends, your coworkers, and your kids and family see you being intentional with your time, you’ll give them permission to question their own “always on” default and step away from their own Infinity Pools. You aren’t just making time for yourself and your own Highlight; you’re also setting a good example for the people around you. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1392))\n\n---\n\nMy phone used to call to me from my pocket the way the Ring called to Bilbo Baggins. The second I felt even the slightest twinge of boredom, my phone would appear in the palm of my hand as if by magic. Now, without Infinity Pool apps, I feel less twitchy. Those moments when I used to instinctively reach for my phone, I’m forced to pause—and it turns out those moments are not so boring after all. ([Location 1418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1418))\n\n---\n\nDelete social apps. First, delete Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and so on (including whatever else has been invented since we wrote this). Don’t worry. If you change your mind later, it is very easy to install these apps again. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1445))\n\n---\n\nDelete other Infinity Pools. Anything with an infinite supply of interesting content should be deleted. This includes games, news apps, and streaming video like YouTube. If you might refresh it obsessively and/or lose hours without meaning to, get rid of it. ([Location 1448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1448))\n\n---\n\nLog Out Typing in your username and password is a hassle, so websites and apps make sure you don’t have to do it very often. They encourage you to stay logged in, leaving the door to distraction wide open. ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1479))\n\n---\n\nNotifications are not your friends. They’re nonstop attention thieves. Whether or not you try a distraction-free phone, you should at the very least turn off almost all notifications. Here’s how. ([Location 1499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1499))\n\n---\n\nLeaving your devices behind is a helpful tactic when you want to make time for an “offline” Highlight like reading to your kids or working on a project with your hands. ([Location 1549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1549))\n\n---\n\nWhen you wake up in the morning, whether you slept for five hours or ten, you’ve had a nice long break from the Busy Bandwagon and the Infinity Pools. This is a golden moment. The day is fresh, your brain is rested, and you have no reason to feel distracted yet. No news items to stress about, no work emails to stew over. ([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1575))\n\n---\n\nThe morning is prime time for my Highlight, which usually involves the computer. So each night I do myself a favor by closing all my browser tabs (#26) and logging out of Twitter and Facebook (#18). Then, after I wake up and make coffee, I’m ready to start my Highlight without any distractions from the morning check-in. ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1585))\n\n---\n\nWe’ve got some breaking news of our own: You don’t need to follow the daily news. True breaking news will find you, and the rest isn’t urgent or just doesn’t matter.

And when they’re staring you right in the face, tasks such as checking email, responding to a chat, and reading the news feel urgent and important—but they rarely are. If you want to get into Laser mode faster, we recommend putting your toys away.

A young Jake stood on the blistered rock and imagined the awesome force of impact. The crater is thirty times the size of the meteor! It’s crazy to think about such a small object making such a big hole. Or maybe it’s not so crazy. After all, the same thing happens in our daily lives. Small distractions create much larger holes in our day. We call these holes “time craters,” ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1732))\n\n---\n\nSports have a powerful grip on us. They satisfy an innate tribal urge. We grow up watching local teams with our parents, families, and friends. We discuss sports with colleagues and strangers. Each game and season has an unpredictable story line, but (unlike real life) they all finish with clear-cut win-or-lose outcomes that we find deeply gratifying. ([Location 1797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1797))\n\n---\n\nEventually, our email took on a life of its own. We were supposed to be clearing it out of the way so that we could do our work, but instead, on most days, email was the work.11 It was a vicious cycle: The faster we replied, the more replies we got back and the more we strengthened the expectation of immediate responses. ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1835))\n\n---\n\nIf you check email less often, research suggests that you’ll be less stressed and just as on top of things. A 2014 study by the University of British Columbia found that when people checked their email just three times a day (instead of as often as they wanted), they reported remarkably lower stress. As researchers Elizabeth Dunn and Kostadin Kushlev put it, “Cutting back on email might reduce stress as much as picturing yourself swimming in the warm waters of a tropical island several times a day.” Maybe more surprising, checking less often made the participants better at email. During the week when they checked three times a day, people answered roughly the same number of messages, but they did so 20 percent faster. Checking email less often measurably made time! ([Location 1841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1841))\n\n---\n\nInstead of checking your email first thing in the morning and then getting sucked in and reacting to other people’s priorities, deal with email at the end of the day. That way, you can use your prime hours for your Highlight and other important work. ([Location 1850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1850))\n\n---\n\nWhen you know you’ve got time set aside later, it’s easier to avoid wasting time on email now. And if you schedule your email time before a firm commitment such as a meeting or leaving the office, you’ll get an additional boost: When email time is done, it’s done. ([Location 1856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1856))\n\n---\n\nyou’re better off treating email like old-fashioned paper letters—you know, the kind with envelopes and stamps. Snail mail gets delivered only once a day. Most letters sit on your desk for a while before you do anything about them. And for 99 percent of communications, that works just fine. Try slowing down and seeing your email as what it really is: just a fancy, dressed-up, high-tech version of regular old mail.

You could say something like this: “I’m slow to respond because I need to prioritize some important projects, but if your message is urgent, send me a text.” ([Location 1891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B078QSCM3V\u0026location=1891))\n\n---\n\nAs we see it, all that TV time is a gold mine: a large pile of perfectly good hours just lying there, ready to be reclaimed.

When someone else is waiting expectantly for results, it’s a lot easier to get into Laser mode. The trouble is that deadlines are usually for things we dread (like doing taxes), not for things we want to do (like practicing the ukulele). But this is an easy problem to solve. You can invent a deadline.

For example, if your Highlight is “Plan vacation,” you can explode it into bits like these: Check calendar for vacation dates. Skim guidebook and make list of possible destinations. Discuss destinations with family and choose favorite. Research airfare online. Note that each item includes a verb. Each one is specific. And each one is small and relatively easy. We learned this technique from productivity shaman David Allen, who has this to say about breaking projects into physical actions: Shifting your focus to something that your mind perceives as a doable, completable task will create a real increase in positive energy, direction, and motivation.

Paper is less intimidating, too—while most software is designed to guide you through a series of steps that will lead to a finished product, paper allows you to find your own way to a cohesive idea. And paper opens up possibilities, because whereas Word is designed for lines of text and PowerPoint is designed for graphs and bullet points, on paper, you can do anything at all.

Not too much. Mostly plants. Well, we read Pollan’s books and tried his advice, and darned if it didn’t work. Eating real food—in other words, nonprocessed ingredients Urk would recognize, such as plants, nuts, fish, and meat—made a huge difference in our energy levels.

But once the caffeine wears off, all that adenosine is still hanging around, ready to pounce. If you don’t recaffeinate, you crash. And over time, your body adjusts to more and more caffeine by producing more and more adenosine to compensate. This is why, if you normally drink lots of caffeine, you probably feel extra groggy and headachy when you don’t have it.

So if the average person has a coffee at 4 p.m., half the caffeine is out of the bloodstream by 9 or 10 p.m., but the other half is still around.

Take a break and leave your headphones at home. Just listen to the sounds of traffic, or the clack of your keyboard, or your footsteps on the pavement. Resist the itch to fill the blank space.

This is a big deal, especially if you consider the findings from Harvard’s 75-year Study of Adult Development: People with strong relationships are more likely to live long, healthy, fulfilling lives. We’re not claiming that talking to strangers in the grocery store checkout line will help you live to be 100—but spending time with people face-to-face can be a big energy booster.

Here’s a simple experiment to try: Think of one of those energy-giving people. Go out of your way to have a real conversation with her or him. You can talk in person or on the phone, but your voice must be involved. Afterward, note your energy level.

The problem only comes when we rely on one job for too long, and stop challenging ourselves. That’s when the risk creeps in of becoming a 40-something-year-old who hasn’t upgraded their skills since they were 25.\n\n---\n\nI’ve changed my opinion on the topic of goals in recent times. I used to think they were a bit pointless in that you’re almost signing up to a contract of unhappiness until you hit the goal. But actually having a goal doesn’t mean you’re wedded to it. And without having some kind of destination to aim for in the first place you’ll never set off on the journey. So if you feel like you’re at a crossroads, just pick something and start moving towards it. It’s much easier to change direction when you’re moving forward rather than when you’re stationary.\n\n---\n\n“Every Sunday reflect on how the week previous went and look to see if there are new opportunities that you can be pivoting your goal for” \\[57:49\\] I first came across weekly review stuff when I read Getting Things Done by David Allen about 5 years ago - but I’ve done about 4 weekly reviews since then.

She gets a box, like a literal, like a crate and she just puts things in the box one at a time that she's studying or looking at like a, like a mix tape of music. She might want to use a book, some photos, you know, some some some snapshots Polaroids. Uh, and just stacks things. And she talks about how it creates this almost like history of the project where she wants to know where it started.

Like that's what we learned have been learning up until now. It's like, oh that's your visual cortex, this is the auditory center, this is where fear the amygdala is for fear right? But that's not that's not really how it how it works. Um The different parts of the brain can and do take on different functions right to the point that their stories of people losing half their brain like half from accidents or birth defects and they can still lead a normal life.

Like for me, my home base was organizing. I just, I love to organize. It's like, it's beautiful, it's like patterns and structures and the act of creating categories to me is very satisfying. Um but when I became self employed, I had to train myself and it's really hard to go past organizing and distilling, express. Distilling still to this day is painful for me. I'm like, I'm cutting, it's like cutting out these ideas that I spent so much time and they're so beautiful and lovely ideas, their precious, they're like my Children, how can I put them aside? And other people of the opposite? They're good at expressing like my wife Lauren, she's an express her, she's a verbal processor and so what she's done is sort of gone ([Time 0:07:08](https://www.airr.io/quote/612bdd4f49af99000f11fa21))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: to work with. \nSpeaker 0: So I want to close by talking about the connectedness of these four things. Why is it worth thinking about collect organized distill end express as a unified idea rather than four disconnected parts. \nSpeaker 1: Excellent point. That's the other side of the spectrum, right? Is that's something I also want to avoid as well is the random collection of tips and tricks and you see this you know that the classic airport business book you pick it up and it's like okay, each one of these ideas is interesting and potentially useful but they're not leading to anything, there's nothing greater than the sum of its parts.

Distill it down. What is the most essential at the level of a folder or a tag? But also even within a note itself. But then you have a final problem which is, wow, you know, this is the moment the turning point I love seeing is when people realized, wait a minute, they look through their second brain, their digital notes and they just realized I have so much that feeling of scarcity, that scarcity mindset in their brain that I don't have enough. I don't know enough. I haven't done enough. I am not good enough. Is just obliterated in the face of the visual evidence that they have a ridiculous abundance of knowledge wealth in front of them.

When the book comes out, it will most likely be in the *self improvement* section. You know, it's about being more effective at life having better results, um being less stressed and doing more with less right productivity, if ([Time 0:00:00](https://www.airr.io/quote/612ff01be042d5000f4d2881))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 1: constraints and deadlines and priorities and things, but just to wake up and do what we feel like, think about what we feel like pursue whatever calls to us, whatever inspires us, right? So to me that I'm already anticipating like *retirement* or just in the future and thinking, okay, if I'm going to have nothing on my mind, I need to start preparing for that, I need to start outsource instead of taking on all the responsibility to myself, doing all the kinds of thinking myself. How can I already start delegating? You know, the most basic kinds of thinking to start to machines, to computers so that over time I can have less on my mind instead of more. \nSpeaker 0: Yeah, but the ([Time 0:01:45](https://www.airr.io/quote/612ff08ae042d5000f4d30a7))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: what it's good at, which is remembering and you're focused on what you're good at, which is open ended thinking. \nSpeaker 1: Yeah, that's a great point. It's another parallel to *Finance*. You know, I never wanted to think about my finances budget save because I thought, oh, that's for retirement, decades from now. But then when you go through really looking at your finances, the benefits are instantaneous. You right away once you start budgeting, let's say, start having *less stress*. You know, where your money is coming from, where it's stored, where it's going. You make better decisions, you're less impulsive, you have just a greater sense of security. So it's like you're using that the future projection to make changes that benefit you right now.

It's stuff that doesn't add that much value. And it's stuff that is very routine and repeatable, answering emails, scheduling things, you know, uh summarizing their reading, writing up reports or plans or agendas. It's like this kind of just bread and butter of knowledge work that is the perfect target for stuff like the stuff that you want to delegate to your second brain. How can you turn those repeatable low value activities into *notes*, into *checklists*, into *templates*, into *models*, into things that don't require you to reinvent them from scratch each time that you can just access the results of your past thinking.  Speaker 0: I think one of the things that's such a deep assumption is that in order to achieve more we need to work harder. We need to expel more energy. We need to grind and stuff like that. But what a second brain is is it's about one time actions that have multi time benefits. \nSpeaker 1: Exactly compounding again finance right?

But how it gets from the input to the output is a little unclear um but I do think that that ([Time 0:03:58](https://www.airr.io/quote/612ff8a5dbfd52000e023dd0))\n\n---\n\nSpeaker 0: visited it before you click there. You have some memory of where on the page that answer is you go through all those steps so quickly that it's as if you know it, even though if I forced you to come up with it without google, you wouldn't be able to write. So I think google in a funny way has actually introduced us to this idea of like cognitive extension um more than we realize. But there's a couple things that we can't do. Okay, so a couple things first, Google doesn't have your version of that knowledge, *your interpretation*, your take because when you come across a google result you can't edit it. That's control that's owned, that's literally owned and monetized by someone else or some other company. So if you have any interpretation, even if even if that's just you want to put more emphasis on a idea instead of the idea, you can't change it. There's nothing no *highlighting*, no *reorganizing*, no [editing](Editing.md), no *annotating* none of that you can do on that web page. But there's something else too, which is there's this idea in the world of finance of *Alpha*, right? This idea that there's certain knowledge that is not universally known, that you can't just do a google search. You can't just look it up either because it's not well distributed, it's not widely known, it's not on the internet, it's only in the minds of certain people, for example, and that's the most valuable knowledge. It's not on the internet, it's only in the minds of certain people, for example, and that's the most valuable knowledge, right?

Because what I hear in that, in that comment is this idea that I have figured out the ultimate perfect way for them to be successful. They need to just perfectly copy and mimic my perfect way and I just couldn't be further from the truth. I mean, unless they happen to have my exact life circumstances, my exact same temperament and personality, my same learning style, my same goals, unless they are a, a literal clone of me than my system will not be their system.

And there's something else too. I mean, that's a that's an extreme example, but just They they really lose the plot. If you can remember what happened, you know, 30 years ago, the same as yesterday, The level of detail in your head becomes like a noise, nothing gets forgotten, nothing falls away. Everything is front and center. It's like having 50 stereos right in front of you all turned up to maximum volume, right? Um and so I think more and more in the study of the human brain, we're understanding that forgetting is actually a powerful capability and then you go to digital note taking and people are doing everything they can to never ever forget anything ever. Isn't that an interesting paradox? Right? So I'm actually curious like I want to know, taking out that has forgetting as a future if you don't access a note or at least you know, change it or edit it or modify or distillate in some way, after a certain period of time it just falls away just gets deleted.

Okay with randomness. How do you actually help me figure this out \nSpeaker 0: to s models and experiments? Okay, so the first is models.

Since then, I have rarely been without a Field Notes notebook in my back pocket. These Field Notes notebooks represent my short-term memory. They contain fleeting notes, lists, ideas, names of people.\n\n[Handwritten notes are a form of short-term memory](../Handwritten%20notes%20are%20a%20form%20of%20short-term%20memory.md)\n\n---\n\nMy process for capturing my notes in Obsidian is straight-forward. At the end of each day, I open my Daily Notes file for the day and do the following: Flip through notes in my Field Notes notebook looking for anything worth saving. Transfer those items worth saving into my daily notes. Elaborate on these as necessary. Most of what I jot in these notebooks stays in the notebooks. The most common things to go into Obsidian are: blog post ideas notes jotted about things I read or listed to notes from experiences, like tours, museum visits, etc1.\n\n---\n\n4. A notebook gets me off screens, for at least some of the day I try to avoid screens for everything. When I walk in the morning and have an idea for a post, or want to jot a note on the book I am listening to, I don’t want to look at a screen. My notebook provides a convenient way to capture fleeting thoughts without depending on my phone.\n   [Find time away from screens](../Find%20time%20away%20from%20screens.md)\n\n---\n\nIt is difficult to search the notebooks this way.

We can stop asking what others can do for us, and start asking what we can do for others. ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=62))\n\n---\n\nWriter David Foster Wallace said that he thought good nonfiction was a chance to “watch somebody reasonably bright but also reasonably average pay far closer attention and think at far more length about all sorts of different stuff than most of us have a chance to in our daily lives.” Amateurs fit the same bill: They’re just regular people who get obsessed by something and spend a ton of time thinking out loud about it.

Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of what they’re not sharing. Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=97))\n\n---\n\nShare what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you.

Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages in your process. Shoot video of you working. This isn’t about making art, it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you. Take advantage of all the cheap, easy tools at your disposal—these days, most of us carry a fully functional multimedia studio around in our smartphones.

Science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon once said that 90 percent of everything is crap. The same is true of our own work. The trouble is, we don’t always know what’s good and what sucks. That’s why it’s important to get things in front of others and see how they react. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=235))\n\n---\n\nOf course, don’t let sharing your work take precedence over actually doing your work. If you’re having a hard time balancing the two, just set a timer for 30 minutes. Once the timer goes off, kick yourself off the Internet and get back to work. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=243))\n\n---\n\nIf you’re unsure about whether to share something, let it sit for 24 hours. Put it in a drawer and walk out the door. The next day, take it out and look at it with fresh eyes. Ask yourself, “Is this helpful? Is it entertaining? Is it something I’d be comfortable with my boss or my mother seeing?” There’s nothing wrong with saving things for later. The save as draft button is like a prophylactic—it might not feel as good in the moment, but you’ll be glad you used it in the morning. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=261))\n\n---\n\nDon’t think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine. Online, you can become the person you really want to be. Fill your website with your work and your ideas and the stuff you care about. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=295))\n\n---\n\nIf you happened to be wealthy and educated and alive in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, it was fashionable to have a Wunderkammern, a “wonder chamber,” or a “cabinet of curiosities” in your house—a room filled with rare and remarkable objects that served as a kind of external display of your thirst for knowledge of the world. Inside a cabinet of curiosities you might find books, skeletons, jewels, shells, art, plants, minerals, taxidermy specimens, stones, or any other exotic artifact. These collections often juxtaposed both natural and human-made marvels, revealing a kind of mash-up of handiwork by both God and human beings. They were the precursors to what we think of today as the modern museum—a place dedicated to the study of history, nature, and the arts. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=309))\n\n---\n\nThere’s not as big of a difference between collecting and creating as you might think. A lot of the writers I know see the act of reading and the act of writing as existing on opposite ends of the same spectrum: The reading feeds the writing, which feeds the reading. “I’m basically a curator,” says the writer and former bookseller Jonathan Lethem. “Making books has always felt very connected to my bookselling experience, that of wanting to draw people’s attention to things that I liked, to shape things that I liked into new shapes.” ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=319))\n\n---\n\nOur tastes make us what we are, but they can also cast a shadow over our own work. “All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste,” says public radio personality Ira Glass. “But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer.” Before we’re ready to take the leap of sharing our own work with the world, we can share our tastes in the work of others. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=323))\n\n---\n\nHuman beings want to know where things came from, how they were made, and who made them. The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel and what they understand about your work, and how people feel and what they understand about your work affects how they value it. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=399))\n\n---\n\nThe way to get over the awkwardness in these situations is to stop treating them as interrogations, and start treating them as opportunities to connect with somebody by honestly and humbly explaining what it is that you do. You should be able to explain your work to a kindergartner, a senior citizen, and everybody in between. Of course, you always need to keep your audience in mind: The way you explain your work to your buddies at the bar is not the way you explain your work to your mother. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=448))\n\n---\n\nBest of all, when you share your knowledge and your work with others, you receive an education in return. Author Christopher Hitchens said that the great thing about putting out a book is that “it brings you into contact with people whose opinions you should have canvassed before you ever pressed pen to paper. They write to you. They telephone you. They come to your bookstore events and give you things to read that you should have read already.” He said that having his work out in the world was “a free education that goes on for a lifetime.” ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=502))\n\n---\n\n“When people realize they’re being listened to, they tell you things.” —Richard Ford ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B00GU2RGGI\u0026location=508))\n\n---\n\nNo matter how famous they get, the forward-thinking artists of today aren’t just looking for fans or passive consumers of their work, they’re looking for potential collaborators, or co-conspirators.

It’s a simple way to know who you should let in and out of your life. If, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire. Of course, The Vampire Test works on many things in our lives, not just people—you can apply it to jobs, hobbies, places, etc. Vampires cannot be cured.

In such a system, I might: Sit down to my morning writing and see a small handful of writing prompts for the day, drawn from my writing inbox I can choose to append whatever’s top of mind about any of them (perhaps they obscure what was written previously until I’ve added new material) Once I’ve done that, I can mark the prompt as “fruitful,” meaning it’ll come up again relatively soon, or “unfruitful,” in which case the system will increase its interval substantially. Alternately, I might take a moment to convert one of these prompts into one or more Evergreen notes. Any prompts which I simply ignore will have their intervals increased, but perhaps not as substantially as explicitly-unfruitful prompts. By taking advantage of the exponential nature of spaced repetition intervals, one could make incremental progress on potentially hundreds of prompts, while considering only a few on any given day. This would represent a system for incremental thinking.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.491904793-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Splitting-Time-Between-Product-and-Engineering-Efforts-CSS-Tricks-CSS-Tricks":{"title":"Splitting Time Between Product and Engineering Efforts  CSS-Tricks - CSS-Tricks","content":"\n# Splitting Time Between Product and Engineering Efforts | CSS-Tricks - CSS-Tricks\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Akson*\n* Full Title: Splitting Time Between Product and Engineering Efforts | CSS-Tricks - CSS-Tricks\n* URL: https://css-tricks.com/splitting-time-between-product-and-engineering-efforts/?cmdid=867QBRUURFDI4Y\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nCommunication\nOnce you figure out what problem you would like to tackle, it’s critical to write up a small one-sheeter that you can share with stakeholders on the nature of the work, the amount of time it’s going to take, and why it’s important. \n[Define the problem](../Define%20the%20problem.md)\n[New Design Template](../New%20Design%20Template.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.687213452-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Sql":{"title":"Sql","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81AuHUh8RlL._SY160.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Keith Dvorjak*\n* Full Title: Sql\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nUNION clause is required to combine the results of two or more select statements in a single table.

In my experience, it’s in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are. You’re ready. Start making stuff.

The writer Wilson Mizner said if you copy from one author, it’s plagiarism, but if you copy from many, it’s research. I once heard the cartoonist Gary Panter say, “If you have one person you’re influenced by, everyone will say you’re the next whoever.

Don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes. The reason to copy your heroes and their style is so that you might somehow get a glimpse into their minds.

But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized he couldn’t completely pull them off because he didn’t have the same body type as the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his own. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0074QGGK6\u0026location=187))\n\n---\n\nSo: Copy your heroes.

Write the kind of story you like best—write the story you want to read. The same principle applies to your life and your career: Whenever you’re at a loss for what move to make next, just ask yourself, “What would make a better story?” ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open\u0026asin=B0074QGGK6\u0026location=218))\n\n---\n\nThe manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use—do the work you want to see done.

Step 2: Invite others to wonder with you. You should wonder at the things nobody else is wondering about. If everybody’s wondering about apples, go wonder about oranges.

So, I ride the bus to and from work, even though it’s 20 minutes faster to drive. I go to a barbershop that’s first-come, first-served, without Wi-Fi, and always busy with a wait of a few hours. I keep my laptop shut down at the airport. I hang out in the library. I always carry a book, a pen, and a notepad, and I always enjoy my solitude and temporary captivity.

It’s pretty wonderful. And disorienting. And a major high. But I always know that high will taper off, and a few weeks down the road I will have a dark day when I want to quit, when I wonder why the heck I even bother with this stuff. That’s why I put every really nice e-mail I get in a special folder. (Nasty e-mails get deleted immediately.) When those dark days roll around and I need a boost, I open that folder and read through a couple e-mails. Then I get back to work.

It seems contradictory, but when it comes to creative work, limitations mean freedom. Write a song on your lunch break. Paint a painting with only one color. Start a business without any start-up capital. Shoot a movie with your iPhone and a few of your friends. Build a machine out of spare parts. Don’t make excuses for not working—make things with the time, space, and materials you have, right now.

It's easy to get lost in the task at hand and forget about why you love doing your job. To stay motivated, you need to stay connected to your excitement, your passion, and to visualize the things you want to turn into realities. Transferring this enthusiasm to people who work for you isn't always easy. It's a challenge to stay in sync with team members and coordinate your reasons for achieving goals. Sometimes you have to use a carrot and sometimes it's a stick – but if you're not excited about what you're doing, then you should stop working for it.

That way, when we look back at our notes, we can always tell which ideas are most exciting to a total beginner. This is often the stuff that’s most worth writing about. Here’s how the Novelty Index works in practice: Take a note when something interests or surprises you, (including when you strongly disagree with something). Write down a score (1-5) of how much it surprised or interested you at the time. Later on, use this ranking system to decide what ideas you should write about. If something was super-novel and exciting to you a few months ago (4 or 5 points), it’s probably a good topic to write about - even if your future self thinks “this is old news - why would I write about that?”.\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.806997093-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-P.A.R.A.-System-and-the-Importance-of-Folders-RescueTime-Blog":{"title":"The P.A.R.A.

Who are influencers?\nSenior engineers\nDeveloper evangelists/community relations\nRecruiters\nHiring managers\nWe want to meet these people in a way that is authentic and natural, and then follow up with them #status/review \n\n---\n\nWhen you go to an event or a meetup, do you find yourself awkwardly standing around, compulsively looking at your phone? Do you feel alone or uncomfortable? The truth is, nearly everyone else is feeling the same way. When it comes down to it, people want to feel welcomed and accepted #status/review \n\n---\n\nBack when I was new to financial sales, I had a very simple strategy for feeling less awkward. I'd scan the room to find someone who looked alone and uncomfortable (like me), and smile and introduce myself. Then I'd start asking them questions about their business #status/review \n\n---\n\nTactic 1: Smile and Say Hi\nYes, it's really that easy. This has been my go-to opener for years with people. I walk up to someone, give them a warm smile, offer my hand out, and just say, \"Hi, I'm Sam! What's your name?\" If they've got a name tag, I'll ask something innocuous like, \"What brings you here?\" Like I said above, people love to feel welcomed and accepted. #status/review \n\n---\n\nTake, for example, a \"tech famous\" core team contributor of your favorite framework. That person gets bombarded daily with mostly criticism and sometimes abject flattery. Any time I meet someone whose software I use or whose book I loved, I simply smile, shake their hand, and say:\n\"Hi, I'm Sam. I just wanted to take a moment to thank you in person for the work you're doing. It really makes my life easier every day.\" #status/review \n\n---\n\nOnce you've expressed genuine appreciation, you need to master the art of finding common ground. Your best go-tos are always:\nHobbies (think board games or knitting)\nLocation (from the same small town in Ohio?)\nSchool (same high school, same college, rival college)\nEntertainment (here's your chance to talk about Harry Potter, or sports, or TV shows) #status/review \n\n---\n\nNever spend more than a few minutes in these interactions #status/review \n\n---\n\nTake a few minutes to get to know the person, and then say something like this:\n\"Hey, it was really great talking to you for a minute. I've got a few other people I want to be sure to catch before I take off. I'd love to keep in touch, though - do you have a card?\"\nI know, I know, we're in tech and people don't often carry cards. That's okay. The point is not the medium itself, the point is that I asked them for a means of following up. Do not just hand them a card or tell them your Twitter handle. They will never follow up with you #status/review \n\n---\n\nTactic 6: Follow Up (No one does this!)\nFollowing up is the single most important tactic here, but it requires the most skill. You have to learn how to follow up without being creepy or too persistent. Luckily, this is pretty straightforward.\nAfter a few days, but no more than a week, contact them in their preferred medium. It's this easy:\nSubject: Great meeting you! \\[keep it simple\\]\nHi Susan,\nJust wanted to send you a quick note to say that it was great meeting you at the Famous Tech Conference last week. I bet that Michigan weather is a tough adjustment after all that sunshine. \\[something personal about them\\]\nTake care, \\[courteous without being creepy\\] Sam Julien P.S. My friends are still trying to convince me to play Scythe, but I hear it's even more complicated than Netrunner. I'm doomed. \\[callback to whatever common connection you made\\]\nNotice I'm still not asking for a job or anything. I'm still building the relationship.\nIf they don't respond, that's fine. Not everyone has time to respond to every single email. Hopefully, they'll respond in a friendly tone with similar banter. If not, don't sweat it. #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.831125915-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Peloton-Experience-A-Usability-Heuristics-Analysis-by-Samantha-Rapa-Aug-2021-UX-Collective":{"title":"The Peloton Experience A Usability Heuristics Analysis  by Samantha Rapa  Aug, 2021  UX Collective","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Samantha Rapa*\n* Full Title: The Peloton Experience: A Usability Heuristics Analysis | by Samantha Rapa | Aug, 2021 | UX Collective\n* Category:\n* URL: https://uxdesign.cc/the-peloton-experience-c072e305fad6?cmdid=69CNJEXGR07ICX\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nThe first principle we look at is the Aesthetic-Usability Effect. Users tend to perceive an aesthetically pleasing design as more usable than its less attractive competitors. A positive response is triggered in people’s brains, causing them to think the design actually works better than it does\n- Note: [Design](../moc/Design.md)\n\n---\n\nVisibility of System Status heuristic states that the design should always keep users informed about what is going on. Appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time is important here, and Peloton does this throughout the user journey. During a workout class there is a bar at the top of the screen that shows where you are in the class at all times, but can be hidden if desired. Every button clicked shows appropriate, instant feedback.\n- Note: Should we show that the front end is connected and/or how long this chart has been open?\n.Design\n\n---\n\nHick’s Law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. Peloton recognizes this and uses a few techniques to counter this. When response times are most critical, they minimize choices. After a workout is complete, Peloton suggests a few cool down/post-workout class options for users to click quickly and efficiently after a workout without spending the time trying to select one of the many options for a post-workout\n\n---\n\nPeak-End Rule. This states that people judge an experience based largely on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than an average of how they felt throughout the entire experience. Peloton has placed most emphasis on the peak and end of the user’s journey. At the most intense point of the user journey, you are partaking in a class which is the most enjoyable part of the journey. At its end, you receive a reward for doing your personal best or making any achievements\n\n---\n\nGoal-Gradient effect states that the closer you get to a goal, the higher the tendency to approach that goal. Peloton employs two features to encourage users to complete more workouts in relation to this principle. The display of artificial progress helps ensure users will have more motivation to complete tasks. The progress bar at the top of the screen during a workout is broken down into segments, showing you when you’ve hit certain milestones\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:29.06837369-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Results-Equation-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail":{"title":"The Results Equation - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Shawn Blanc*\n* Full Title: The Results Equation - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n* Category:\n* URL: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzGllVqqTHKTPdlhGMjBKmLhlQSG\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nResults = Clarity x Focus x Time\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.326807541-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Revenge-of-Analog":{"title":"The Revenge of Analog","content":"\n# The Revenge of Analog a Book Review\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *curtismchale.ca*\n* Full Title: The Revenge of Analog a Book Review\n* URL: https://curtismchale.ca/2019/07/31/the-revenge-of-analog-a-book-review\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nWhen it comes to the free flow of ideas, the pen remains mighter than both the keyboard and touchscreen ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01g48y7772mhq4rmmkvg9gzxtc))\n[Analog vs Digital Tools](../moc/Analog%20vs%20Digital%20Tools.md)\n\n---\n\nBefore Sax dives into the sections he also wants to make the point that going digital only or analogue only is a false choice.

This matters for two reasons. The obvious one is that whoever is wrong about the disagreement will improve their models of the world. The less obvious one is that both participants in the one-on-one get better at imagining what the other person would think about something, which is critical for building a high-trust working relationship. #status/review \n\n---\n\nUncertainties. The founders always encouraged me to use 1-on-1s to ask about anything I was uncertain about, even if it didn’t affect my day-to-day work. If anything, I spend more attention worrying about things that don’t affect my day-to-day work (because those are the things I can’t control), so I’d often end up a lot less stressed after these discussions. For the founders, I think these discussions helped them discover problems with internal communication—for instance, occasionally I’d get worried about some strategically important project elsewhere in the company because they’d forgotten to announce progress reports on it. #status/review \n\n---\n\nI also now think the “caring a lot” qualification is way more important than I used to. Lots of people (including Eve) try having “accountability buddies” that they meet with to discuss progress on their goals, and accountability buddies are rarely this effective. The main difference is that most accountability buddies don’t care about each other in the same way that managers/reports, or significant others, do: for me, Eve’s progress was the top idea in my mind in a way that I doubt it was for anyone else. Because of that, I ended up having more insightful feedback for her than a random “accountability buddy” might. #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:28.807081357-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/These-Questions-Are-Changing-My-Life-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail":{"title":"These Questions Are Changing My Life - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Full Title: These Questions Are Changing My Life - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail\n* URL: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzGmvBnThKNpwmjQKjvPvNfqKsvf\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\n1. The Kickstart Question: What’s on your mind? This gets to the heart of the conversation. It’s another way of saying let’s talk about the thing that matters most. The person we’re talking to will be relieved on multiple levels: a) we’ve skipped the small talk b) we’re letting them immediately address the main issue c) they’re being listened to. #status/review \n\n---\n\nA good way for us to deepen the conversation (once we’ve discovered the main problem), is to ask which one of the three P’s they’d like to discuss: a) Project - the technical content of their problem. b) Person - issues with colleagues, family, etc. c) Pattern of behaviour - are they getting in their own way? #status/review \n\n---\n\n2. The AWE Question: And what else? Asking and what else? stops us from diving in with advice after hearing someone’s problems. It also gets all of the issues on the table, because the first-level answer to what’s on your mind may not address the biggest issue. #status/review \n\n---\n\n3. The Focus Question: What’s the real challenge here for you? Everyone loves fixing problems, ticking them off on the to-do list. But we rarely stop to ask “are we solving the right problem?”\\* When we ask what’s the real challenge her for you?, we give our conversation partner time to slow down and think about what their real problem is, before they put loads of work into a possibly pointless solution. #status/review \n\n---\n\n5. The Lazy Question: How can I help? If we haven’t already got a clear request from asking what do you want, then how can I help should do the trick. More importantly, this question is efficient. It stops us from kind of doing what the other person wants, but not accurately enough that it’s actually useful. #status/review \n","lastmodified":"2022-10-06T09:00:29.014193606-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Think-With-Paper-and-Store-Conclusions-Digitally-Decoding":{"title":"Think With Paper and Store Conclusions Digitally – Decoding","content":"\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Zsolt Benke*\n* Full Title: Think With Paper and Store Conclusions Digitally – Decoding\n* URL: https://decoding.io/2021/05/think-with-paper-and-store-conclusions-digitally/\n\n## Highlights\n\n---\n\nYou can use paper to get an order in random ideas by doing doodles, wireframes, mindmaps, diagrams, or what have you.

Scrutinize your past self.**\nOne of my favorite exercises is the [failure resumé](../failure%20resum%C3%A9.md), which I learned about from [Tina Seelig](http://www.tinaseelig.com/) at Stanford University. Many of us labor endlessly on our resumés, scrubbing and buffing them until they shine. That’s cool. The marketing department has a job to do. But the research and development department is feeling a little left out. So, when you’re done Turtle-Waxing your LinkedIn Profile, try Tina’s technique. Compile all your failures, screwups, missteps and blunders. List them in a single column on a spreadsheet or document. Then next to each flub, write — in a single sentence — the lesson you learned from it. I’ve done this. It wasn’t fun. But it delivered two important insights. First, in some cases, there *wasn’t* lesson to be learned. Solid decisions don’t always produce fantastic outcomes. Fortune is fickle. Shit happens. That can be a relief — a way to move forward, unburdened by the setback and better informed about the vicissitudes of life. Second, in compiling the failure resumé, I discovered that at the core of many of the screwups were the same two decision-making mistakes. The failure resumé surfaced the two mega-errors Past Dan had been making, which helped Future Dan avoid them.

Because typing is a [fine motor skill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_motor_skill) (it coordinates small muscle movements), it’s highly [feedback-dependent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control#Open_loop_control).

My framework for ensuring a blog post accomplishes both is to start with a first draft that focuses on \"novel\" ideas.\nA novel idea is one that's not just new to the reader, but also significant and not easily intuited. Think of it as new and *worthwhile*. ([View Highlight](https://julian.com/guide/write/ideas?__readwiseLocation=0%2F5%2F0%2F7%3A0%2C2%2F6%2F0%2F7%3A1#:~:text=People%20read%20nonfiction%20to%20learn%2Cit%20as%20new%20and%20worthwhile.))\n\nJulian mentions there are five novelty categories:\n\n* **Counter-intuitive** — \"Oh, I never realized the world worked that way.\"\n* **Counter-narrative** — \"Wow, that's not how I was told the world worked!\"\n* **Shock and awe** — \"That's crazy. I would have never believed it.\"\n* **Elegant articulations** — \"Beautiful. I couldn't have said it better myself.\"\n* **Make someone feel seen** — \"Yes! That's exactly how I feel!\"\n  [Five Novelty Categories](../Five%20Novelty%20Categories.md)\n\n---\n\nNovelty is what gives readers dopamine hits. You find novel ideas by pursuing your curiosity and noting what interests and surprises you along the way. If it intrigues you, it'll likely intrigue your readers too.

Resonance is when ideas take root in readers' minds. It's the art of capturing their imaginations and relating to their life experiences so that they *feel*.

Share a solution to a tough problem. [Example](https://www.julian.com/blog/life-planning).\n1.

Articulate something everyone’s thinking about but no one is saying. Cut through the noise.\n1. Identify key trends on a topic. Then use them to predict the future.\n1. Contribute original insights to a field through your research and experimentation.# Writing Handbook: How to Source Writing Ideas\n\n---\n\nYour objective clarifies what you're trying to accomplish, and your motivation ensures you actually see it through. That’s all that's needed to write with conviction: pair an objective with a motivation. When writers lack one of these, they tend to not finish their articles. If the right objective and motivation combo isn't coming right away, that's okay. Start writing like you would in a diary to uncover what's in the back of your head. As you write, a clear objective will eventually emerge. At that time, do a full rewrite with your clear objective as your guiding light. \n\n---\n\nWe write to clear our minds, reflect on our experiences, force ourselves to dive deeper, satisfy our curiosities, teach others, build reputation, and hone our craft.
