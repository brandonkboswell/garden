I grew up in a very small town and we only had dial up internet, but I had an excellent communications teacher, Tracy Wainwright who taught English, Yearbook, Advanced Comm (Morning News) and Newspaper. I wasn't a fan of English, but I loved Yearbook and Advanced Comm. It was in her Yearbook class that I began using Adobe Photoshop, InDesign \u0026 Illustrator. \n* I got pretty decent in those and started creating my own form of awful high school digital art and told my Mom and I wanted to go to art school. She talked me out if it and convinced me to go to business school for Marketing. Effectively the same field but from the opposite end of the table. \n* While in college I worked in a local print shop and that was where I actually got good with the Adobe suite. One of our largest customers at the print shop was Virginia Women's Center, the main OBGYN group in Richmond. They would constantly order business cards and all of the cards followed a standard template. \n* The marketing lead would send us the information for the business card and we would update the business card and send them a proof. They would approve it and then we would print it. \n* I found myself spending so much time just doing this process, so I decided I would see if I could automate this. This was my path to engineering. \n* I wrote a web application where they could add their employee roster and the information for the business card and a script in InDesign that could talk to that API ingest that information to XML and apply that XML to the template. \n* Fast forward a few years. I finish my MBA...\n* After finishing my Master's program, I moved from Richmond, VA to DC to be involved in the startup scene. I was involved in a startup at the 1776 Incubator in DC. That's how I met David Fairbrothers, Dorsata CEO. One evening when my first startup was coming to a close I had David show me what he and Greg Herrington were planning for Dorsata. \n* We saw all of these exciting apps being built for consumer use cases, but healthcare was not part of this. Why could we have these highly polished workflows for posting what we ate for dinner, but Doctors are forced to use what is essentially a Microsoft Access Database for managing the care of 1000's of people. It just seemed so backwards. The opportunity to make an impact here was to just so high.","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.504784253-04:00","tags":null},"/My-Morning-Routine":{"title":"My Morning Routine","content":"* At the start of the day we grab *coffee* and do [Morning Pages](sources/Morning%20Pages.md)\n  * It doesn't have to be at the desk if we don't want to.\n  * We will avoid:\n    * *Twitter*\n    * *Feedly*\n    * *Reddit*\n    * [Wordle](Wordle.md)\n  * Those are reserved for later on the day when our brain needs a break from the non-stop work.\n\n## Relates to:\n\n[Most productive time of the day](seedlings/There%20is%20a%20two%20hour%20window%20in%20each%20day%20where%20you%20are%20most%20productive..md)\n[Time Traps](Time%20Sinks.md)","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:42.844368194-04:00","tags":null},"/My-Phone-is-Ruining-My-Creativity":{"title":"My Phone is Ruining My Creativity","content":"Author: *Eric Floberg* \nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecx8u4inJHM\n\n[Boredom breeds creativity](Boredom%20breeds%20creativity.md)\n\nTherefore, avoiding being bored is the death of creativity.\n\n## Basic steps you can try:\n\n* [Don't check your phone for the first hour you wake](Don't%20check%20your%20phone%20for%20the%20first%20hour%20you%20wake.md)\n* Don't check your phone while moving\n* Don't check your phone on the toilet\n* Don't check your phone the hour before bed\n\n[Time Traps](Time%20Sinks.md)","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:44.454132081-04:00","tags":null},"/My-favorite-digital-workflow-apps":{"title":"My favorite digital workflow apps","content":"\u003e \n \u003e I'm a digital workflow nerd.

Record in a small, quiet room\n\nRecord in the smallest and quietest room possible to reduce outside noise and echoes. Shut windows and doors, turn off noise-making machines or devices, and put pets out of the room. Fill your recording space with soft items (couches, pillows, carpet, etc.) to muffle any errant noises. \n\n2. Keep your body still\n\nMoving your body around creates background noise while recording. This happens a lot if you use earbud headphones. The wire lays close to your chest which causes the microphone to rub against your shirt and collar. Try to stay still in your chair with your feet planted. Avoid moving things around on your desk.\n\n#### Speech\n\n3. Be yourself\n\nYou’re here because we already know you’re a great human and speaker! Don’t worry about “likes” or “ums.” Using filler language like “uhhhh” or “y’know?” is a sign that you’re speaking casually. Try not to keep track of your “like” count.\n\n4. Signal Non-verbally\n\nIn a regular conversation, we can see smiles, frowns, fidgets, and more. That’s hard to do in a podcast! Smiling makes you sound friendly. Vary your vocal inflection. If you are trying to convey a particular emotion — genuine interest! shock! delight! — it really helps.\n\n5. Don’t be afraid to re-do\n\nIf you feel you were unclear, misspoke, or would just like a re-do, you can always say “let me try that again”. You can also always flag it audibly for our editor “Hey Editor, please don’t include that!” either after you’ve said it, or the end of the recording. Your privacy matters.\n\n#### Style\n\n6. Stay aware of time  \n   Given that Moss \u0026 Friends is a 30 minute podcast, consider which stories should take priority, and keep the rest concise.\n\n6. Have fun  \n   Moss and Friends is ultimately a few friends having a chat about the things we care about: healthcare, wellness, and design. It’s okay to make jokes, laugh, and speak as you would in any conversation with your friends.\\*\\*","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:42.497838211-04:00","tags":null},"/Poka-Yoke":{"title":"Poka-Yoke","content":"*Seth Godin*\n\nMistake proofing, or its Japanese equivalent poka-yoke (pronounced PO-ka yo-KAY), is the use of **any automatic device or method that either makes it impossible for an error to occur** or makes the error immediately obvious once it has occurred.","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:42.400391022-04:00","tags":null},"/Polymath":{"title":"Polymath","content":"A polymath is **a person who knows a lot about a lot of subjects**.

It basically became my inbox for everything: Tasks, Ideas, Funny things that people said that I didn't want to instantly forget. I came to the realization that as long as I could get the item into TickTick I would act on it. \n\nThe issue I found was although TickTick has good quick capture and dictation built in, there was no way they could do it fast enough for what I wanted. Mostly because of limitations in iOS. At least on my iPhone XS it can only boot so fast and it only can be ready for input so fast. \n\nSo I set out to see if I could create a quick capture that was instantly ready for input and that I could easily dictate to while in the shower or driving in the car. \n\nHere's where I landed:\n\n* Tap Quick Capture: to type in a quick task\n* I could tap the same for Dictate\n* If I'm in another app and realize there's something I need to do late I can double tap the back of my phone to open the quick capture.\n* Lastly if I'm in driving in the car or get an idea while in the shower I can say Hey Siri, Jot\n\nAlright so let me show you how to set this up:\nQuick Capture \n\nThe Dictation Workflow \n\n* New Shortcut\n* Choose a New: In this case Jot this Down\n* Choose Add Action\n  * Search for Dictate Text\n* Search for TickTick\n  * Choose Add Single Task and Choose Dictated Text\n  * Spin open the Options Arrow and be sure to Enable Edit in App. An interesting issue with Shortcut workflows is they don't open the app and the apps don't get a chance to send your newly created item to the cloud which means your newly created item only exists on your device which is exactly what we don't want. If you choose Edit in App then TickTick will open and your item will be available anywhere you access TickTick.\n  * From here you can hit the share button at the bottom and choose Add to Home Screen\n    * You can change the icon by tapping here on the left and you can change the App name here on the right. Choose add and you've got a Quick Capture App you can launch from the Home Screen\n\nAlright on to the Quick Capture Workflow:\n\n* Same initial steps as before \n  * New Shortcut\n  * Name it \n  * Choose Add Action\n    * Search for TickTick\n    * Add a Single Task\n      * Tap where it says task and choose Ask Each Time. Press Done on your keyboard\n      * Spin open the arrow and enable edit in App\n    * Lets give it a spin.\n    * If it asks would you like to Allow Your shortcut to share data with TickTick then choose Allow\n    * To make it launch on Double tapping the back of your phone:\n      * Go to settings -\u003e Accessibility -\u003e Touch -\u003e Back Tap -\u003e. Double Tap  and choose your Shortcut from the bottom of the list.\n      * Now Double tapping the back of your iPhone will launch your quick capture shortcut.\n\n* There you have it. That's how I quick capture and dictate with TickTick for iOS. If this was helpful to you please leave a like and comment. Also I have a video on how I use Alfred to Quick launch anything. You can check it out right here.","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:44.106812093-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/How-I-Use-Obsidian":{"title":"How I Use Obsidian","content":"Setting up your Obsidian Vault for Personal Knowledge Management can be daunting. You start from scratch, there are 1000's of plugins to chose from, and honestly it all becomes one big distraction from actually generating thoughts and ideas. In this video, I will share my approach to managing an Obisidian vault in hopes it will save you a few headaches when starting from scratch. \n\n**Note:** I publish my Obsidian Vault using Github Pages and because of this I use more folders than most vaults you will see. Having folders that I can hide away makes making sure I only share what I intend to share with the Internet. If you haven't already go check out my vault at brandonkboswell.com. I will put a link in the description.\n\n## Folders / Major Areas\n\n* 1-1\n  * *I thoroughly enjoy writing in Obsidian, so I put my 1-1 notes with people I chat with on a regular basis instead of putting them in another app*\n  * It's just a running log with a date and the todos associated with that session\n* Business\n  * A random assortment of notes that I want to keep and link to, but I don't want shared with the world.\n* Collections\n  * Where I collect items I thought were interesting that I want to be able to refer back to, but I might not actually have significant commentary on. Please let me know how you do this in the comments, that way I do this is not ideal. Basically I screenshot or get the URL for whatever it is and then Quick Add to TickTick and then when I clean out my [TickTick](../TickTick.md) Inbox I put it into [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) for storage.\n* Cooking\n  * My wife is a far better cook then I, but I do cook a few meals each week. The issue I always found was I would do a meal and then by the time I cook that meal the next time I couldn't remember what I had tried, so I end up making the same mistakes and not progressing at perfecting the dish. So I started creating cooking notes for these and after each time I cook a dish I put another entry into that note. When I go to start cooking that dish again I refer back to what I had written the last time on what to try next. \n* Ideas\n  * A random assortment of ideas. These are mostly a folder just to make them private when publishing\n* People\n  * My notes on people. This one is also private as it has a bunch of people who didn't ask to be published online.\n* Personal\n  * Pictures of cards, notes people have sent me or deeply personal writing prompts that don't need to be public\n* Projects\n  * A folder where all of the Youtube Videos or Articles start while I'm figuring them out. Currently this folder is not published, but I might make it public soon and then just apply a draft tag to things that shouldn't be published. For instance the script for this video is in there\n* Seedlings\n  * This is where all of my *Atomic Notes* / *Evergreen Notes* go. \n* Sources\n  * This is where all of my Readwise Highlights \u0026 Literary Notes go.\n* Temporal\n  * Daily Notes\n    * Ex: 2022-02-25\n  * Weekly Notes\n    * Ex: 2022-W07\n  * Annual Notes\n    * Ex: [2021 In Review](../2021%20In%20Review.md)\n* To Publish\n  * Articles / Documents that would be useful to the public, but need cleanup / refinement before they can be shared\n* Underscore Gang — I need to find a way to describe this\n  * Index\n  * Content Calendar\n  * Backlogs\n    * Gaming Backlog\n    * Idea Backlog\n    * Book Backlog\n    * Music Backlog\n    * TV Backlog\n  * Seedings\n  * Writing Prompts\n\n## Plugins I use\n\n* See Video where I run through this.\n\n## Themes\n\n* I use the Minimal Theme\n* I've tried the Notational one and the California Coast and they are both good as well, I just happen to like the Minimal Theme slightly more. \n\n[Obsidian](../Obsidian.md)","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.990923102-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/How-I-keep-my-Chrome-Tabs-under-control-with-Merge-All-Windows-Chrome-Extension":{"title":"How I keep my Chrome Tabs under control with \"Merge All Windows\" Chrome Extension","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:44.44395863-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/How-I-use-TickTick-2021":{"title":"How I use TickTick 2021","content":"---\n\n\n \u003e \n \u003e Don’t play “catch and release” with your thoughts.

I'm not going to get into everything that's magical about Alfred because I could ramble way too long about that. Today let's focus on one particular trick for Alfred which is Bookmarks. \n\nI use [Alfred](../Alfred.md) to open Applications all of the time by tapping Option + Space and typing the application I am looking for, but more and more often the applications I use each day are in my web browser, especially the ones that I work on and have to administer. \nOften times there are unique URLs for pages I use, but maybe only once or twice a month. \n\nWherever possible I want to remove looking from things from my workflow and instead I want to be able to find and launch those things as quickly as I can think of them. What I've found recently is I can organize my bookmarks by my logical name for them. Basically what I would call them.\n\nIf I wanted to get to:\n\n* the active sprint view in Jira can just type Active\n* Calendar for *Google Calendar*\n* Any commonly used page for work\n  I can put all of those things in a *Bookmark* folder and call upon them in Alfred.\n\nTo set it up, just open your Alfred Preferences and then choosing Web Bookmarks\nMark sure your preferred browser is checked and mark sure it's set to in Default Results.\nThis last option is just personal preference. \n\nFrom here, Alfred can access your browser's bookmarks and keeps them in sync. If you add a new bookmark just hit Option + Space to open Alfred and then press escape and by the time you open it the next time your newly added bookmark will be there. \n\nEver since I learned this trick, I feel like I can now get to all the places on my Mac that I want as soon as I think of them. Previously, this was only possible for applications.","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.735441524-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Mouseless-MacOS-Window-Management-Yabai-vs-Amethyst":{"title":"Mouseless MacOS Window Management - Yabai vs Amethyst","content":"### Why do you need a window manager at all?\n\n* too much time moving windows around and wanted an easier way to snap two windows side by side or have a window be full screen without having to us MacOS spaces. \n\n### What have I tried?\n\n* I used ShiftIt for a number of years\n* I had 4 basic shortcuts that I would use all the time\n  * Left\n  * Right\n  * Full-Screen\n  * Next Monitor\n* Worked well, but I found that to do most interactions I was doing I ended up needing the mouse to complete them. For example, putting two windows side-by-side would require a mouse to switch focus reliably to the other monitor.\n* I found out that *ShiftIt* was looking for a new maintainer and they were recommending Hammerspoon. \n* Eventually I heard about Yabai and gave it a try. It was very different to what I was using with ShiftIt, but gave a different perspective of window management. Instead of me managing my windows manually, what if they could management themselves.\n* I liked the idea of this, but found it to be a bit unreliable in the MacOS Monterrey Beta which I was running, and started trying to troubleshoot it. I found that BetterTouchTool and it were have weird interactions and once I stopped using BetterTouchTool it worked better. \n* While trying to troubleshoot Yabai I came across Christopher Kapic's Video on Yabai and he mentioned Amethyst. I dug into it and gave it a shot and it seemed to match my needs pretty well. \n* Here are the shortcuts I use (Note I use a hyper key caps locks that is bound to Escape on tap and changes my HJKL keys into arrow keys). This works well for me not needing to leave the home row, but your mileage may vary.\n  * Two Layouts: Tall + Fullscreen\n    * This lets me toggle between tiled and fullscreen which is a habit I have from my Shiftit days\n    * Hyper + Return: Toggle Layout\n    * Shrink \u0026 Expand The Layout with Hyper Plus \u0026 Minus\n    * Move window focus with Hyper ASDF\n      * S \u0026 D move the focus forward and back on the active window\n      * A \u0026 F move focus to the previous and next monitors accordingly\n    * Move Windows with Hyper + ZXCV\n      * X \u0026 C move windows around on the current screen\n      * Z \u0026 V move windows to previous and next monitor\n    * Lastly in order to minimize having to grab my mouse, I set up *O Launching* with Karabiner Elements for my most common apps\n      * Slack\n      * TickTick\n      * Sublime\n      * Chrome\n      * Fantastical\n      * Finder\n      * Spotify\n      * Zoom\n    * Recently turned off my Dock with [TinkerTool](../TinkerTool.md)\n      * The dock being visible was required for me up until about a month ago when I tried TinkerTool and was able to make it so that it would quickly show on demand.","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.35617764-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/My-App-Essentials":{"title":"My App Essentials","content":"* [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md)\n* [TickTick](../TickTick.md)\n* *Skitch*\n* *HandMirror*\n* *Amethyst*\n* *OneThing*\n* *1Password*\n* [Loom](../Loom.md)\n* *GoodNotes*\n* [Readwise](../Readwise.md)\n* *Command*\n\n### Honorable Mentions\n\n* *Drafts*\n* *Spotify* / *Tidal*\n* *iTerm2*\n* *Parcel*\n* *Fantastical*","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:44.19949681-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/My-Favorite-Gear":{"title":"My Favorite Gear","content":"## Desk\n\n* [Kindle Oasis](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Oasis-now-with-adjustable-warm-light/dp/B07F7TLZF4) — If you're buying today, buy the [Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-kindle-paperwhite-Signature-Edition/dp/B08B495319/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=kindle+paperwhite\u0026qid=1649520789\u0026s=amazon-devices\u0026sprefix=kindle+pape%2Camazon-devices%2C204\u0026sr=1-2) instead.

I put a bunch of time into figuring out how all of this would work together, and I probably could have saved a bunch of time by just using Obsidian Publish. Either way, I've learned a ton in setting this up. I also have more control on what does and doesn't get published. I have a ton of private content in my vault and I do not want that being published, which is why I went to all this trouble you're about to see. Yes, I could use multiple vaults, but that seems annoying when you want to link to something that resides in another vault.\n\nSo you're thinking about publishing your [Obsidian](../Obsidian.md) Vault online, but you're not sure if you want to pay for *Obsidian Publish* or not. I've been there, that was the exact same situation I was in when I considered publishing my vault. Call me cheap, but I wasn't sure if I was ready to pay $20 a month for the rest of time. Would I keep writing meaningful content, would people actually ready it? So instead, I decided I was going to figure out a way to publish my vault without the monthly fee. I now publish my vault online, and I don't pay anything for hosting. **(You are currently reading this article from the digital vault that I publish through this method)**\n\n* For me, I cobbled together a combination of:\n  * [**Quartz**](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n    * A nice, clean-looking template for your digital garden that sits on top of *Hugo*. Once you get your bearings with it, you will find that it is just a *Hugo* site and you can customize it a ton if you would like.\n  * **[Obsidian Export](https://github.com/brandonkboswell/obsidian-export/tree/title_frontmatter)** (Slightly Modified)\n    * A Rust based library for converting your Obsidian Vault to standards compliant *Markdown* that supports translating Obsidian style links to standard links that are compatible with Hugo.\n    * Quartz and Hugo both assume that all of your files have a title attribute in their frontmatter. Unfortunately, most of my files do not have this title front matter. I have a branch of obsidian-export (linked above) that uses the file's name to generate titles when that frontmatter is not present. \n  * **[obsidian-hugo](https://github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian)** \n    * *Quartz* has an easy setup that allows you to commit all of your content to *Github* and it will compile everything via *Github Actions*. This is fantastic and super helpful. The issue is I have private content that I don't want on Github.\n    * So instead I use the *obsidian-hugo* library that Quartz's Github Action uses just I use it on my local machine and precompile the filtered content before uploading to Github. This enables me to host my Digital Garden on Github (for free) without risking private content accidentally leaking out onto the internet.\n  * [**Github Pages**](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)\n    * This is where I publish the content that gets output. It's all static html and is being served by Github. There is no amount of traffic I could ever manage to generate that Github couldn't handle.\n\n### Why do I use Obsidian Export when Obsidian Hugo is required by Quartz and does most of the same things?\n\n* **obsidian-export** does a very good job of filtering out files and folders you don't want exported\n* it makes me confident that there is no chance that private data gets uploaded by not even allowing that data to be in the folder that gets parsed\n* It handles bad or no frontmatter so that the downstream pipeline doesn't have any issues\n* You can avoid a bunch of hacks to Quartz (and your layout files) by ensuring that your files have title attributes in their frontmatter. I have hacked together a fork of obsidian-export that does this automatically based on the file name when exporting. https://github.com/brandonkboswell/obsidian-export/tree/title_frontmatter\n\n# High Level Steps (these are from memory as I set this up a few months ago)\n\n1. Clone [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) into a local directory\n1. Create a Repo on Github to host your public garden\n   1. [Getting started with Github Pages](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-personal-website-with-github-pages-and-hugo-6c68592204c7)\n   1. [Configuring a Custom Domain for your Github Pages Site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)\n1. Make the public folder of your Quartz repo a submodule of that repo \n   1. `git submodule add \u003cyour_github_project_url\u003e ./public`\n1. Install Hugo for minifying and running a local server\n   1. `brew install hugo`\n1. Clone obsidian-export wherever you keep libraries\n   1. Obsidian Export runs in *Rust*, so make sure you have Rust enabled on your machine\n   1. If I remember correctly, I ran `cargo build` from the obsidian-export directory to build a local binary that can be called in the compile script\n1. Clone obsidian-hugo wherever you keep libraries\n   1. Obsidian-hugo runs in *Go*, so make sure you have Go enabled on your machine and in your PATH;\n   1. The watch/compile script will run `go run ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian -input=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/content -output=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/assets/indices -index -root=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz;` when it compiles.\n1. Update the compile and watch scripts for the paths of your folders\n   1. My quartz directory is at: ~/Sites/quartz\n   1. My Obsidian Vault is at (My *iCloud* Folder): ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/bkb\n   1. My hugo-obsidian directory is at: ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian\n1. Configure your configuration files\n   1. **Hugo Config** — quartz/config.toml file\n   1. **Quartz Config** — data/config.yaml \n   1. **Quartz Graph Config** — data/graphConfig.yaml\n1. Add a file name **.export-ignore** to your Obsidian Vault\n   1. Obsidian Export will skip any files / folders you mention here and make sure they don't get handed to Quartz\n   1. You can't create this file in Obsidian (you likely want to use the finder or a Code Editor).\n   1. A sample of my .export-ignore file is further down in this article\n1. Run the watch script (which will do an initial compile and then watch for changes to your Obsidian Vault)\n   1. Note that the compile script empties out your quartz/content directory so that files that may have been moved or deleted from your Obsidian Vault do not end up being pushed to the public internet. **Make sure that this path is set correctly before running the watch or compile script.**\n1. Start a hugo server from your quartz directory\n   1. `./serve.sh`\n1. Assuming everything worked, you should be able to preview your vault at: localhost:1313\n1. Tinker / tweak for way too long\n1. When you're ready you can commit your quartz/public directory to Github pages\n   1. **Verify *(especially for the first commit)* that there is nothing private that you don't want uploaded to the internet.**\n   1. `cd ~/Sites/quartz/public; git add .; git commit -m \"Update\"; git push origin`","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:44.441493851-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Quicklaunch-your-commonly-used-applications-with-Karabiner-Elements":{"title":"Quicklaunch your commonly used applications with  Karabiner Elements","content":"## What shortcuts do I use?\n\n* **O Launching**\n  * Originally found it watching a YouTube Video by *Jesse Skelton* which you can find here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaJSjgVEhMQ\n    * M -\u003e Music -\u003e Spotify\n    * I -\u003e IM -\u003e Messages\n    * F -\u003e Files -\u003e Open Downloads Folder\n    * G -\u003e Google Chrome -\u003e Chrome\n    * C -\u003e Calendar -\u003e Fantastical\n    * T -\u003e TickTick -\u003e TickTick\n    * Z -\u003e Zoom -\u003e Zoom\n    * D -\u003e Obsi**d**ian -\u003e Obsidian\n    * E -\u003e Editor -\u003e Sublime Text\n    * S -\u003e Slack -\u003e Slack\n* **Hyper Key**\n  * This gives me an extra set of Keyboard Shortcut triggers without having to develop Carpel Tunnel or having to leave my home row.

I used to have one of the old Macbook Pros with the inverted T Arrow keys, and then with the unibody Macbooks with no ports they decided to screw that up. I had a ton of muscle memory for getting to those keys and never could get that back since they changed this. So last year I decided that I was going to move my arrow keys to the home row so I wouldn't have to leave it. This configuration also has Hyper + G for beginning of line and Hyper + ; for end of line, but I honestly never use those.  I just use Hyper+Command+H or L, there's too much muscle memory there that I can't seem to give up.\n* **Shift+Escape to Tilde**\n  * This is largely just a symptom of having a 65% keyboard and needing to type a tilde where there's no key for it. This is what I chose. I have more 65% keyboard hacks in my Keyboard itself that I should probably do a video on. Let me know in the comments if you have any interest in that.","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:44.045356935-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Quickly-Mark-Up-Mac-Screenshots-on-iPad-Skitch-vs-Markup":{"title":"Quickly Mark Up Mac Screenshots on iPad (Skitch vs Markup)","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.309538961-04:00","tags":null},"/blog/Save-Chrome-Tab-Groups-with-Tabox":{"title":"Save Chrome Tab Groups with Tabox","content":"[Tabox](../Tabox.md)\n\n## What is it\n\n* Tabox is a better version of Tab Groups for Chrome\n  * I think they support Edge as well (but I don't use Edge)\n* It solves for me the problem of needing to keep a set of tabs around forever because I'm not done with it yet\n  * Perhaps I was configuring a new Care Plan at Work, but then I had to run to a meeting.

In this case I halved a bag of brussels sprouts. Add meat to an ungreased pan as the liquid provides enough grease. This time I did 2 minutes per side. I think for next time I should try 2:30. Result: Good sear, perhaps a little too done in places and not enough in others. Perhaps a weight could help to create good contact. The cook was very Medium Rare, could be slightly more done by my standards, but this should largely be a judgement call based on the thickness of the cut.

I did this one at 225, but it got a little hot towards the start. I built a nice big fire, but ended up accidentally putting it out trying to temp it down. In the future, I need to close the cover sooner and cut the oxygen to it before it gets too hot. I cooked the chicken around ~225° until it reached 145°, and then I opened it up in an attempt to get the skin crispy. I think it may have worked, but then I applied the BBQ sauce and that lost any crisp I achieved. I put three pieces of hickory in with the fire today and I think that was too much. For the next one I do, I am going to try a dry rub and not apply a BBQ sauce to see how the skin does this.\n\n\n*2022-04-03*\nDid another Spatchcock Chicken today this time with some new techniques thanks to Dave. I brined the chicken is salt water and some pickle juice for a few hours prior to cooking. (Next time I do it I need to try to dehydrate the skin by drying it off and putting it back into the fridge for a few hours). I brushed it with olive oil on both sides (perhaps I should only do that on the bottom side) and I coated it in a new rub I found here: https://fitfoodiefinds.com/smoked-chicken-dry-rub-recipe/. I did my typical cook at 220 until 145 degrees and then cranked up the temperature to 275ish to crisp the skin. The skin still didn't turn out quite crispy enough but its getting better. I then finished it with the South Carolina BBQ sauce and let that cook on it for 5 minutes or so. The flavor was great and having the BBQ sauce on the outside gave great flavor. \nThis was the first time I've tried serving the chicken in whole pieces. I need to rewatch [How to Brine and Spatchcock a Chicken](../sources/How%20to%20Brine%20and%20Spatchcock%20a%20Chicken.md) to review the proper way to cut a chicken.\n\n### Prior to Sauce\n\n\n\n### Post-Sauce\n\n\n\n### Served for Dinner with *Dad* and *Lois*\n\n\n\n*2022-03-27*\nThis was my second attempt at a Spatchcock Chicken. This time around, we went with a 50/50 mix of salt and pepper. I smoked the Chicken at 250 degree until 145 degrees and then attempted to increase the heat to 275, but unfortunately we had run out of wood and I couldn't get the temperature to rise. I think I've been erring on the side of too little fuel, but there is very little downside to more fuel. I also used significantly too much seasoning this time around, and it was very salty. The amount the first time was right, I just didn't care for the rub much. The meat itself was wonderfully tender, but the skin turned too salty and wasn't crispy enough.\n\n\n*2022-03-20*\nThis was my first time using the *Char-Griller Akorn*. I set an initial fire in the Akorn to get it to 400 degrees to season the grill grate. This worked well, and I had no issues getting the grill to high temperature, even getting it past 500 degrees. I had a minor challenge where I put the fire out while trying to reduce the temperature significantly to get back to a smoking temperature after running it at high heat. After relighting the fire I cooked the chicken between 225 and 275 for an hour and half until the chicken got to an internal temperature of 145 degrees. At the point, I raised the heat to 325 to crisp up the skin and make it easier to get the chicken to temperature. For this chicken we used a KC BBQ rub along with mayonnaise and olive oil on the underside. Initially I didn't put enough seasoning on the chicken, but we later added a bit more. The fire was likely 8 to 2 lump to hickory. The chicken was cooked very nicely, but I found the rub to be too sweet for chicken (its probably better suited for pork). I may try something simpler like just salt and pepper next time to see how that compares. For this cook, we were lacking the smoking stone, but were able to substitute in a baking sheet instead for today. The smoking stone will be here tomorrow along with a thermometer that will talk to my phone so that I can monitor the fire from afar.","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.735483903-04:00","tags":null},"/games/Betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill":{"title":"Betrayal at house on the hill","content":"*Board Games*","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.492560827-04:00","tags":null},"/games/Brass-Empire":{"title":"Brass Empire","content":"*Board Games*\n\nBrass Empire — [](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181393/brass-empire)[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181393/brass-empire](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181393/brass-empire)","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.649041487-04:00","tags":null},"/games/Control":{"title":"Control","content":"---\n\nAccording to HowLongToBeat it takes 11.5 hours (13 hours on Ultimate Edition) to beat, and I am 10.3 hours in.

For me reading puts me to sleep so reading prior to sleep is a win-win for me.\n\nIt helps my brain explore, but also slow down and often leads to a handful of ideas before relaxing and going to sleep. I can normally tell that I'm ready to sleep when I begin reading the same line multiple times or can't retain what I read. \n\nIf you're going to be staying up late I can't think of many things as productive as reading. \n\nI also find that the quality of my sleep is better. Reading calms me and puts my mind and body into a state that makes it easier to transition into sleep. Reading before bed (at least non-fiction) is almost like *Pre-sleep*.\n\nWhen I was younger I had a routine of masturbating before bed to help go to sleep, but looking back now I think this created some form of hormone that caused me to get worse sleep. It's not that I didn't fall asleep easily (I did), but I don't feel that I was as well rested in the morning.","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.391949857-04:00","tags":null},"/seedlings/Reward-yourself-for-setting-goals-and-meeting-them":{"title":"Reward yourself for setting goals and meeting them","content":"*Accountability*\n\nIce Cream / Pizza Party\n\n* Reward yourself for setting goals and meeting them\n* Set Goals\n* Share them","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.240472639-04:00","tags":null},"/seedlings/Start-your-day-with-a-plan-then-spend-the-rest-of-that-day-executing-that-plan":{"title":"Start your day with a plan, then spend the rest of that day executing that plan","content":"---","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:42.697329665-04:00","tags":null},"/seedlings/The-beauty-of-Reddit-is-that-you-can-get-to-the-meta-believed-best-way-to-solution-according-to-a-community-of-any-topic-area-in-a-matter-of-minutes.":{"title":"The beauty of Reddit is that you can get to the meta, believed best way to solution according to a community, of any topic area in a matter of minutes.","content":"*Reddit*\n*Meta*","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:42.49112008-04:00","tags":null},"/seedlings/The-goal-of-PKM-should-be-Better-Thinking-not-better-note-taking":{"title":"The goal of PKM should be Better Thinking, not better note-taking","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.29869855-04:00","tags":null},"/seedlings/The-hour-before-work-is-the-Golden-Hour-for-productivity.-Like-the-last-hour-before-sunset-in-photography-its-the-perfect-conditions-to-succeed":{"title":"The hour before work is the \"Golden Hour\" for productivity.

How will what you do next year help get you closer to your larger goals? \n\n1. **Set you up with a realistic plan for a successful year.** Use [SMART goals](https://rescuetime.wpengine.com/smart-goals-examples/) you can measure throughout the year (not vague wishes and hopes that get dropped by mid-January.)\n\n1. **What went well this year?** \n\n1. **What did not go well this year?**\n\nRemember: It’s easy to overestimate what you can do in a day and underestimate what you can accomplish in a year!\n\n### 2.

Context: What is required to do what you want to do. If you don't have that priority is irrelevant\n1. Time Available: If you don't have time then it doesn't matter either\n1. Resources: Do you have the energy to do it?\n1. Priority: Once all of those things have been met then Priority matters.\n\nWhen prioritizing ask yourself two questions:\nWhats the value in getting this done?\nWhat bad will happen if I don't?\n\nIf you aren’t crystal clear on your priorities, climb up the *Horizons of Focus*, especially to *Areas of Focus* to know what you are actually responsible for personally and professionally. Many times people will do that and realize they have things on their projects and next actions lists that are not really their job. If you are not sure what your areas are (most people have 5–7 personally and 5–7 professionally) then maybe it’s time for some updates on that with people you think can help you get clear on that.","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.142882354-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Projects-Over-Categories":{"title":"Projects Over Categories","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/0/8/8/e/088e8f2ed927f575/second_brain_podcast_300dpi.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: [The Building a Second Brain Podcast](../The%20Building%20a%20Second%20Brain%20Podcast.md)\n* Full Title: Projects Over Categories\n* Category:\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/5e8265e24cc59f6e992e9c0a\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:42.697661321-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Proper-Title-Case-Figma":{"title":"Proper Title Case — Figma","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *a*\n* Full Title: Proper Title Case — Figma\n* URL: https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/776197163275203567/Proper-Title-Case?cmdid=PF68MCA7B7VOPJ\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.837296685-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Quick-Passages":{"title":"Quick Passages","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/quick-passages-book-icon.2489c00a3133.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: \n* Full Title: Quick Passages\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.301334364-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Radical-Candor":{"title":"Radical Candor","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MFKXNZVOL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Kim Scott*\n* Full Title: Radical Candor\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.750047998-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Range":{"title":"Range","content":"Author:  *David Epstein*\nURL: https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World-ebook/dp/B07H1ZYWTM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?\\_encoding=UTF8\u0026qid=\u0026sr=","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:44.385363492-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/Range-Why-Generalists-Triumph-in-a-Specialized-World":{"title":"Range Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World","content":"Generalists are more adaptable than specialists, obviously. \nCreativity has never been more important because computers are augmenting the human mind to take over the more logic driven decision-making.

This makes the dashed items stand out quite well despite the fact that the same color pen or pencil may be used.\n\n(Right Arrow): Waiting – (i.e. for another action) — Drawing an arrow pointing to the the item denotes that it is something that is waiting on another action to happen or deliverable.\n\n(Left Arrow): Delegated — Drawing an arrow pointing to the left of the item denotes that it has been delegated (with a note to whom and the date) .\n\n(Triangle): Data Point — Turning the dash into a triangle denotes a data point (a fact or figure you wish to remember for instance).\n\n(Circle) — A circle around any of the above means that it has been carried forward, moved to another list or otherwise changed status – i.e. a “Waiting” item has now become an Action Item elsewhere (with a note about where that item has gone).","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:44.285485131-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Design-of-Everyday-Things":{"title":"The Design of Everyday Things","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/416Hql52NCL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Don Norman*\n* Full Title: The Design of Everyday Things\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:44.599949476-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-End-of-an-Era":{"title":"The End of an Era","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Book Notes*\n* Full Title: The End of an Era\n* URL: https://aliabdaal.com/the-end-of-an-era/?cmdid=NP7FEKCSV37IPN\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.344607792-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Goldilocks-Fallacy-Seths-Blog":{"title":"The Goldilocks Fallacy  Seth's Blog","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Goldilocks Fallacy | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/09/the-goldilocks-fallacy/?cmdid=SOAFNF1EDGDIKJ\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:44.545753543-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Hedonic-Buffet-Seths-Blog":{"title":"The Hedonic Buffet  Seth's Blog","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Hedonic Buffet | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/10/the-hedonic-buffet/\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:44.036413413-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Lean-Startup":{"title":"The Lean Startup","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N-u8AsmdL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Eric Ries*\n* Full Title: The Lean Startup\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:42.891829376-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Linear-Oppression-of-Note-Taking-Apps":{"title":"The Linear Oppression of Note-Taking Apps","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *maggieappleton.com*\n* Full Title: The Linear Oppression of Note-Taking Apps\n* Category:\n* URL: https://maggieappleton.com/note-oppression\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.239409714-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Miser":{"title":"The Miser","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://thumborcdn.acast.com/tFX2_Opp6vHIrt-wevM3gGcp33k=/1500x1500/https://acast-media.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets/07058b20-e537-4225-9c56-3adf0e2a669a/0603d98ddaac6ed6cf2a400f739e4f191e267c3bb61fec4423b43170ad9bafdbbf361d5958ac77593b6e1892fa0f8918632f80dd295a438f1c1d3cd7cfd4f6f5.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Akimbo*\n* Author: *Seth Godin*\n* Full Title: The Miser\n* Category:\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/611cbfac8a89e40010112d1f\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.800439745-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Next-Big-Idea-Seths-Blog":{"title":"The Next Big Idea  Seth's Blog","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Next Big Idea | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-next-big-idea/?cmdid=FXNBOJQW8BIH6Q\n\n## Highlights","lastmodified":"2022-04-10T23:44:43.191614196-04:00","tags":null},"/sources/The-Novelty-Index":{"title":"The Novelty Index","content":"---\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *mail.google.com*\n* Full Title: The Novelty Index -
