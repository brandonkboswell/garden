For example putting two windows side-by-side would require a mouse to switch focus reliably to the other monitor.\n* I found out that Shiftit was looking for a new maintainer and they were recommending Hammerspoon. \n* Eventually I heard about Yabai and gave it a try. It was very different to what I was using with ShiftIt, but gave a different perspective of window management. Instead of me managing my windows manually, what if they could management themselves.\n* I liked the idea of this, but found it to be a bit unreliable in the MacOS Monterrey Beta which I was running and started trying to troubleshoot it.

I grew up in a very small town and we only had dial up internet, but I had an excellent communications teacher, Tracy Wainwright who taught English, Yearbook, Advanced Comm (Morning News) and Newspaper. I wasn't a fan of English, but I loved Yearbook and Advanced Comm. It was in her Yearbook class that I began using Adobe Photoshop, InDesign \u0026 Illustrator. \n* I got pretty decent in those and started creating my own form of awful high school digital art and told my Mom and I wanted to go to art school. She talked me out if it and convinced me to go to business school for Marketing. Effectively the same field but from the opposite end of the table. \n* While in college I worked in a local print shop and that was where I actually got good with the Adobe suite. One of our largest customers at the print shop was Virginia Women's Center, the main OBGYN group in Richmond. They would constantly order business cards and all of the cards followed a standard template. \n* The marketing lead would send us the information for the business card and we would update the business card and send them a proof. They would approve it and then we would print it. \n* I found myself spending so much time just doing this process, so I decided I would see if I could automate this. This was my path to engineering. \n* I wrote a web application where they could add their employee roster and the information for the business card and a script in InDesign that could talk to that API ingest that information to XML and apply that XML to the template. \n* Fast forward a few years. I finish my MBA...\n* After finishing my Master's program, I moved from Richmond, VA to DC to be involved in the startup scene. I was involved in a startup at the 1776 Incubator in DC. That's how I met David Fairbrothers, Dorsata CEO. One evening when my first startup was coming to a close I had David show me what he and Greg Herrington were planning for Dorsata. \n* We saw all of these exciting apps being built for consumer use cases, but healthcare was not part of this. Why could we have these highly polished workflows for posting what we ate for dinner, but Doctors are forced to use what is essentially a Microsoft Access Database for managing the care of 1000's of people.

Record in a small, quiet room\n\nRecord in the smallest and quietest room possible to reduce outside noise and echoes. Shut windows and doors, turn off noise-making machines or devices, and put pets out of the room. Fill your recording space with soft items (couches, pillows, carpet, etc.) to muffle any errant noises. \n\n2. Keep your body still\n\nMoving your body around creates background noise while recording. This happens a lot if you use earbud headphones. The wire lays close to your chest which causes the microphone to rub against your shirt and collar. Try to stay still in your chair with your feet planted. Avoid moving things around on your desk.\n\n#### Speech\n\n3. Be yourself\n\nYou’re here because we already know you’re a great human and speaker! Don’t worry about “likes” or “ums.” Using filler language like “uhhhh” or “y’know?” is a sign that you’re speaking casually. Try not to keep track of your “like” count.\n\n4. Signal Non-verbally\n\nIn a regular conversation, we can see smiles, frowns, fidgets, and more. That’s hard to do in a podcast! Smiling makes you sound friendly. Vary your vocal inflection. If you are trying to convey a particular emotion — genuine interest! shock! delight! — it really helps.\n\n5. Don’t be afraid to re-do\n\nIf you feel you were unclear, misspoke, or would just like a re-do, you can always say “let me try that again”. You can also always flag it audibly for our editor “Hey Editor, please don’t include that!” either after you’ve said it, or the end of the recording. Your privacy matters.\n\n#### Style\n\n6. Stay aware of time  \n   Given that Moss \u0026 Friends is a 30 minute podcast, consider which stories should take priority, and keep the rest concise.\n\n6. Have fun  \n   Moss and Friends is ultimately a few friends having a chat about the things we care about: healthcare, wellness, and design. It’s okay to make jokes, laugh, and speak as you would in any conversation with your friends.\\*\\*",lastmodified:"2022-01-23T23:41:33.424175973-05:00",title:"Podcasting Tips for Guests from Moss"},"/Poka-Yoke":{content:"*Seth Godin*\n\nMistake proofing, or its Japanese equivalent poka-yoke (pronounced PO-ka yo-KAY), is the use of **any automatic device or method that either makes it impossible for an error to occur** or makes the error immediately obvious once it has occurred.",lastmodified:"2022-01-23T23:41:33.516136166-05:00",title:"Poka-Yoke"},"/Polymath":{content:"A polymath is **a person who knows a lot about a lot of subjects**.

Resources: Do you have the energy to do it?\n1. Priority: Once all of those things have been met then Priority matters.\n\nWhen prioritizing ask yourself two questions:\nWhats the value in getting this done?\nWhat bad will happen if I don't?\n\nIf you aren’t crystal clear on your priorities, climb up the *Horizons of Focus*, especially to *Areas of Focus* to know what you are actually responsible for personally and professionally. Many times people will do that and realize they have things on their projects and next actions lists that are not really their job.

Individual items (action items and ideas) are marked with a dash preceding them. All items, no matter what they are, are therefore treated as items to be processed.\n\n(Plus): Done Action Item — If the item is an action item (todo), when the item is complete, a vertical line is drawn through the “dash” thus making it resemble a “plus”. This makes the dashed items stand out quite well despite the fact that the same color pen or pencil may be used.\n\n(Right Arrow): Waiting – (i.e. for another action) — Drawing an arrow pointing to the the item denotes that it is something that is waiting on another action to happen or deliverable.\n\n(Left Arrow): Delegated — Drawing an arrow pointing to the left of the item denotes that it has been delegated (with a note to whom and the date) .\n\n(Triangle): Data Point — Turning the dash into a triangle denotes a data point (a fact or figure you wish to remember for instance).\n\n(Circle) — A circle around any of the above means that it has been carried forward, moved to another list or otherwise changed status – i.e. a “Waiting” item has now become an Action Item elsewhere (with a note about where that item has gone).",lastmodified:"2022-01-23T23:41:33.579721208-05:00",title:"The Dash Plus Syste"},"/sources/The-Design-of-Everyday-Things":{content:"---\n\n# The Design of Everyday Things\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/416Hql52NCL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Don Norman*\n* Full Title: The Design of Everyday Things\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-01-23T23:41:33.392528802-05:00",title:"The Design of Everyday Things"},"/sources/The-Goldilocks-Fallacy-Seths-Blog":{content:"---\n\n# The Goldilocks Fallacy | Seth's Blog\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Goldilocks Fallacy | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/09/the-goldilocks-fallacy/?cmdid=SOAFNF1EDGDIKJ\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-01-23T23:41:33.519728416-05:00",title:"The Goldilocks Fallacy  Seth's Blog"},"/sources/The-Hedonic-Buffet-Seths-Blog":{content:"---\n\n# The Hedonic Buffet | Seth's Blog\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Hedonic Buffet | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/10/the-hedonic-buffet/\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-01-23T23:41:33.585965279-05:00",title:"The Hedonic Buffet  Seth's Blog"},"/sources/The-Lean-Startup":{content:"---\n\n# The Lean Startup\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N-u8AsmdL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Eric Ries*\n* Full Title: The Lean Startup\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-01-23T23:41:33.563252409-05:00",title:"The Lean Startup"},"/sources/The-Linear-Oppression-of-Note-Taking-Apps":{content:"---\n\n# The Linear Oppression of Note-Taking Apps\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *maggieappleton.com*\n* Full Title: The Linear Oppression of Note-Taking Apps\n* Category:\n* URL: https://maggieappleton.com/note-oppression\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-01-23T23:41:33.447629826-05:00",title:"The Linear Oppression of Note-Taking Apps"},"/sources/The-Miser":{content:"---\n\n# The Miser\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://thumborcdn.acast.com/tFX2_Opp6vHIrt-wevM3gGcp33k=/1500x1500/https://acast-media.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets/07058b20-e537-4225-9c56-3adf0e2a669a/0603d98ddaac6ed6cf2a400f739e4f191e267c3bb61fec4423b43170ad9bafdbbf361d5958ac77593b6e1892fa0f8918632f80dd295a438f1c1d3cd7cfd4f6f5.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Akimbo*\n* Author: *Seth Godin*\n* Full Title: The Miser\n* Category:\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/611cbfac8a89e40010112d1f\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-01-23T23:41:33.500922335-05:00",title:"The Miser"},"/sources/The-Next-Big-Idea-Seths-Blog":{content:"---\n\n# The Next Big Idea | Seth's Blog\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Next Big Idea | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-next-big-idea/?cmdid=FXNBOJQW8BIH6Q\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-01-23T23:41:33.527990478-05:00",title:"The Next Big Idea  Seth's Blog"},"/sources/The-Novelty-Index-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail":{content:"---\n\n# The Novelty Index -
