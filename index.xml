I&amp;rsquo;ve been there, that was the exact same situation I was in when I considered publishing my vault. Call me cheap, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I was ready to pay $20 a month for the rest of time. Would I keep writing meaningful content, would people actually ready it?

<p>NOTE: The easiest way to publish your vault online is by using 

<a href="https://obsidian.md/publish" rel="noopener">Obsidian Publish</a>. I put a bunch of time into figuring out how all of this would work together, and I probably could have saved a bunch of time by just using Obsidian Publish. Either way, I&rsquo;ve learned a ton in setting this up. I also have more control on what does and doesn&rsquo;t get published. I have a ton of private content in my vault and I do not want that being published, which is why I went to all this trouble you&rsquo;re about to see. Yes, I could use multiple vaults, but that seems annoying when you want to link to something that resides in another vault.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking about publishing your 




<a href="/Obsidian" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/Obsidian">Obsidian</a> Vault online, but you&rsquo;re not sure if you want to pay for <em>Obsidian Publish</em> or not. I&rsquo;ve been there, that was the exact same situation I was in when I considered publishing my vault. Call me cheap, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was ready to pay $20 a month for the rest of time. Would I keep writing meaningful content, would people actually ready it? So instead, I decided I was going to figure out a way to publish my vault without the monthly fee. I now publish my vault online, and I don&rsquo;t pay anything for hosting. <strong>(You are currently reading this article from the digital vault that I publish through this method)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For me, I cobbled together a combination of:
<ul>
<li>

<a href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz" rel="noopener"><strong>Quartz</strong></a>
<ul>
<li>A nice, clean-looking template for your digital garden that sits on top of <em>Hugo</em>. Once you get your bearings with it, you will find that it is just a <em>Hugo</em> site and you can customize it a ton if you would like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>

<a href="https://github.com/brandonkboswell/obsidian-export/tree/title_frontmatter" rel="noopener">Obsidian Export</a></strong> (Slightly Modified)
<ul>
<li>A Rust based library for converting your Obsidian Vault to standards compliant <em>Markdown</em> that supports translating Obsidian style links to standard links that are compatible with Hugo.</li>
<li>Quartz and Hugo both assume that all of your files have a title attribute in their frontmatter. Unfortunately, most of my files do not have this title front matter. I have a branch of obsidian-export (linked above) that uses the file&rsquo;s name to generate titles when that frontmatter is not present.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>

<a href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian" rel="noopener">obsidian-hugo</a></strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Quartz</em> has an easy setup that allows you to commit all of your content to <em>Github</em> and it will compile everything via <em>Github Actions</em>. This is fantastic and super helpful. The issue is I have private content that I don&rsquo;t want on Github.</li>
<li>So instead I use the <em>obsidian-hugo</em> library that Quartz&rsquo;s Github Action uses just I use it on my local machine and precompile the filtered content before uploading to Github. This enables me to host my Digital Garden on Github (for free) without risking private content accidentally leaking out onto the internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart" rel="noopener"><strong>Github Pages</strong></a>
<ul>
<li>This is where I publish the content that gets output. It&rsquo;s all static html and is being served by Github. There is no amount of traffic I could ever manage to generate that Github couldn&rsquo;t handle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-do-i-use-obsidian-export-when-obsidian-hugo-is-required-by-quartz-and-does-most-of-the-same-things">Why do I use Obsidian Export when Obsidian Hugo is required by Quartz and does most of the same things?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>obsidian-export</strong> does a very good job of filtering out files and folders you don&rsquo;t want exported</li>
<li>it makes me confident that there is no chance that private data gets uploaded by not even allowing that data to be in the folder that gets parsed</li>
<li>It handles bad or no frontmatter so that the downstream pipeline doesn&rsquo;t have any issues</li>
<li>You can avoid a bunch of hacks to Quartz (and your layout files) by ensuring that your files have title attributes in their frontmatter. I have hacked together a fork of obsidian-export that does this automatically based on the file name when exporting.

<h1 id="high-level-steps-these-are-from-memory-as-i-set-this-up-a-few-months-ago">High Level Steps (these are from memory as I set this up a few months ago)</h1>
<ol>
<li>Clone 

<a href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz" rel="noopener">Quartz</a> into a local directory</li>
<li>Create a Repo on Github to host your public garden
<ol>
<li>

<li>

<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site" rel="noopener">Configuring a Custom Domain for your Github Pages Site</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Make the public folder of your Quartz repo a submodule of that repo
<ol>
<li><code>git submodule add &lt;your_github_project_url&gt; ./public</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Install Hugo for minifying and running a local server
<ol>
<li><code>brew install hugo</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Clone obsidian-export wherever you keep libraries
<ol>
<li>Obsidian Export runs in <em>Rust</em>, so make sure you have Rust enabled on your machine</li>
<li>If I remember correctly, I ran <code>cargo build</code> from the obsidian-export directory to build a local binary that can be called in the compile script</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Clone obsidian-hugo wherever you keep libraries
<ol>
<li>Obsidian-hugo runs in <em>Go</em>, so make sure you have Go enabled on your machine and in your PATH;</li>
<li>The watch/compile script will run <code>go run ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian -input=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/content -output=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/assets/indices -index -root=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz;</code> when it compiles.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Update the compile and watch scripts for the paths of your folders
<ol>
<li>My quartz directory is at: ~/Sites/quartz</li>
<li>My Obsidian Vault is at (My <em>iCloud</em> Folder): ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/bkb</li>
<li>My hugo-obsidian directory is at: ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Configure your configuration files
<ol>
<li><strong>Hugo Config</strong> — quartz/config.toml file</li>
<li><strong>Quartz Config</strong> — data/config.yaml</li>
<li><strong>Quartz Graph Config</strong> — data/graphConfig.yaml</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add a file name <strong>.export-ignore</strong> to your Obsidian Vault
<ol>
<li>Obsidian Export will skip any files / folders you mention here and make sure they don&rsquo;t get handed to Quartz</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t create this file in Obsidian (you likely want to use the finder or a Code Editor).</li>
<li>A sample of my .export-ignore file is further down in this article</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Run the watch script (which will do an initial compile and then watch for changes to your Obsidian Vault)
<ol>
<li>Note that the compile script empties out your quartz/content directory so that files that may have been moved or deleted from your Obsidian Vault do not end up being pushed to the public internet. <strong>Make sure that this path is set correctly before running the watch or compile script.</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Start a hugo server from your quartz directory
<ol>
<li><code>./serve.sh</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Assuming everything worked, you should be able to preview your vault at: localhost:1313</li>
<li>Tinker / tweak for way too long</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re ready you can commit your quartz/public directory to Github pages
<ol>
<li><strong>Verify <em>(especially for the first commit)</em> that there is nothing private that you don&rsquo;t want uploaded to the internet.</strong></li>
<li><code>cd ~/Sites/quartz/public; git add .; git commit -m &quot;Update&quot;; git push origin</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>You probably want to do your ignoring of personal files at the obsidian-export level because if a file is referenced in another file, but that file is flagged as a draft in the frontmatter then hugo-obsidian will have trouble with that and make hugo error on compile with the backlinks. Doing your ignoring of specific files in obsidian-export takes care of this.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve never used <em>Hugo</em> before (like I hadn&rsquo;t prior to this project), you may not know that Hugo has a static folder that generates assets you want to be in any subsequent rebuilds. When I first started this project I added a bunch of lines to the compile script to create files and moving files around when all I really needed to do was add those files to my static folder.</li>
<li>You are going to want to update your Hugo layout files to take advantage of the backlink rendering provided by Obsidian Export. The changes you&rsquo;ll want to make, plus an explanation are available here:

</ul>
<h2 id="previous-attempts">Previous Attempts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Originally I modified hugo-obsidian to get around the no titles issue, since I now do this in obsidian-export I no longer need to maintain a fork of that code. If it&rsquo;s useful to you, here is the change I made:
<ul>
<li>I had to make a minor modification to obsidian-hugo because it assumes that all of your files have a title attribute in their frontmatter. Unfortunately, most of my files do not have this title front matter. I have a branch of obsidian-hugo that uses the file&rsquo;s name to generate titles if that frontmatter is not present.

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>new</strong> — I am trying out differentiating slightly between review and new by having new be used for writing content within Obsidian and review being for reviewing content by others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>review</strong> — Initial status upon coming into the vault from an outside source such as Readwise. The intention here is to review it at least once after the initial writing to see if my opinions have changed after time away from the idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>draft</strong> — A start for an idea, but is not likely ready to publish yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>priority</strong> — A topic that should receive focus before starting any additional explorations. The goal here is to get better at finding a starting point with which to work in the garden</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>stub</strong> — A idea with some initial content, but could benefit from additional exploration and documentation. This is similar to a <em>Wikipedia</em> stub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>shrub</strong> — An idea that has good bones, but is not definitive on the topic. I think this is the further status I have gotten on any of my MOCs.</p>

This was my first time using the <em>Char-Griller Akorn</em>. I set an initial fire in the Akorn to get it to 400 degrees to season the grill grate. This worked well, and I had no issues getting the grill to high temperature, even getting it past 500 degrees. I had a minor challenge where I put the fire out while trying to reduce the temperature significantly to get back to a smoking temperature after running it at high heat. After relighting the fire I cooked the chicken between 225 and 275 for an hour and half until the chicken got to an internal temperature of 145 degrees. At the point, I raised the heat to 325 to crisp up the skin and make it easier to get the chicken to temperature. For this chicken we used a KC BBQ rub along with mayonnaise and olive oil on the underside. Initially I didn&rsquo;t put enough seasoning on the chicken, but we later added a bit more. The fire was likely 8 to 2 lump to hickory. The chicken was cooked very nicely, but I found the rub to be too sweet for chicken (its probably better suited for pork). I may try something simpler like just salt and pepper next time to see how that compares. For this cook, we were lacking the smoking stone, but were able to substitute in a baking sheet instead for today. The smoking stone will be here tomorrow along with a thermometer that will talk to my phone so that I can monitor the fire from afar.</p>

</ul>
<p>I have much higher quality headphones than the Airpods, but some combination of the noise cancellation, weightlessness, and the lack of a cable makes a huge difference in helping me focus on what I need to get done. I do find it odd that I can either listen to calm, quiet music or aggressive dubstep and they both enable the same thing, but they do. I find listening to unfamiliar music with forward lyrics difficult for <em>concentration</em>. The noise cancellation is also helpful because I find the constant fan noise of the

To be completely clear, I have not personally tried an ultrawide monitor, but I would think screensharing and moving windows around would be annoying on one.
