This was my first time using the<em>Char-Griller Akorn</em>. I set an initial fire in the Akorn to get it to 400 degrees to season the grill grate. This worked well, and I had no issues getting the grill to high temperature, even getting it past 500 degrees. I had a minor challenge where I put the fire out while trying to reduce the temperature significantly to get back to a smoking temperature after running it at high heat. After relighting the fire I cooked the chicken between 225 and 275 for an hour and half until the chicken got to an internal temperature of 145 degrees. At the point, I raised the heat to 325 to crisp up the skin and make it easier to get the chicken to temperature. For this chicken we used a KC BBQ rub along with mayonnaise and olive oil on the underside. Initially I didn&rsquo;t put enough seasoning on the chicken, but we later added a bit more. The fire was likely 8 to 2 lump to hickory. The chicken was cooked very nicely, but I found the rub to be too sweet for chicken (its probably better suited for pork). I may try something simpler like just salt and pepper next time to see how that compares. For this cook, we were lacking the smoking stone, but were able to substitute in a baking sheet instead for today. The smoking stone will be here tomorrow along with a thermometer that will talk to my phone so that I can monitor the fire from afar.</p><hr><h3 id="references">References</h3><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JJx4eZNmz4" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JJx4eZNmz4</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0de3Q9hQSTA" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0de3Q9hQSTA</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y7gM1deyvw&amp;t=1s" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y7gM1deyvw&t=1s</a></p></description></item><item><title>Tabox</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/Tabox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 21:43:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/Tabox/</guid><description><p><a href="/Chrome-Extensions" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/Chrome-Extensions">Chrome Extensions</a></p><p><a href="/projects/Save-Chrome-Tab-Groups-with-Tabox" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/projects/Save-Chrome-Tab-Groups-with-Tabox">Save Chrome Tab Groups with Tabox</a></p></description></item><item><title>Loom</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/Loom/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 21:40:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/Loom/</guid><description><p><a href="https://www.loom.com/" rel="noopener">https://www.loom.com/</a></p><p>One of the best ways to communicate and do Show and Tells in<a href="/moc/Design" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="/moc/Design">Design</a> and<em>Engineering</em>.

The Navy Seals think of people in a Performance vs Trust matrix. Ideally you want the high performance, high trust individual, but if you can&rsquo;t have that person you should value high trust over high performing. The high performing, low trust person is toxic to your team. Medium performance individuals can be taught.</p></description></item><item><title>Productive ways to spend downtime between meetings</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/Productive-ways-to-spend-downtime-between-meetings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 11:37:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/Productive-ways-to-spend-downtime-between-meetings/</guid><description><hr><h3 id="references">References</h3><p><a href="sources/2x2%20Improve%20Your%20Life%20Without%20Trying%20-%20brandonkboswell@gmail.com%20-%20Gmail" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="sources/2x2%20Improve%20Your%20Life%20Without%20Trying%20-%20brandonkboswell@gmail.com%20-%20Gmail">2x2 Improve Your Life Without Trying - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</a></p></description></item></channel></rss>
