<p>Speaker 0: to it. The idea is in her book, she calls it elastic habits. If you have a brittle habit, if you have a habit that is dependent on all the stars aligning on everything happening just right, the timing is right. You have all of the kind of overhead that you need to have out of the way. You know, you have the right resources at hand, you have the right energy at hand and all of that has to happen in in particular specific ways. If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re waiting on than your habit is brittle, your behavior becomes brittle (

If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re waiting on than your habit is brittle, your behavior becomes brittle and discipline is the opposite of this picture. Discipline says, I&rsquo;m going to find a way I&rsquo;m going to look at my circumstance and adapt to it so that I can still accomplish the thing that I set out to accomplish with this habit building process.

A disciplined approach, adapts to the circumstance. Maybe the disciplined approach in this case is that you can&rsquo;t exercise at the gym, but the gym is not really the thing that you care about. The thing that you&rsquo;re disciplined about is being active and so you re arrange your thinking and you make time in your schedule later in the day to go for a jock in this specific way, discipline is about finding the core of what matters and not letting go of it undisciplined (

<p>Speaker 0: I don&rsquo;t want you to hear me incorrectly here. Discipline does not mean that you have boundless energy. Discipline doesn&rsquo;t mean that you unwisely push into territory that is dangerous to push into. So what is the practical takeaway? If you want to become a disciplined person, you have to think about discipline differently. When you&rsquo;re developing a habit, get to the core, the essence of what you care about. What is the effect that you&rsquo;re trying to achieve? What is the goal, develop flexibility with your habits, (
