<hr>
<p>The first principle we look at is the Aesthetic-Usability Effect. Users tend to perceive an aesthetically pleasing design as more usable than its less attractive competitors. A positive response is triggered in peopleâ€™s brains, causing them to think the design actually works better than it does</p>
<ul>
<li>Note:
<a href=/moc/Design rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/moc/Design>Design</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Visibility of System Status heuristic states that the design should always keep users informed about what is going on. Appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time is important here, and Peloton does this throughout the user journey. During a workout class there is a bar at the top of the screen that shows where you are in the class at all times, but can be hidden if desired. Every button clicked shows appropriate, instant feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: Should we show that the front end is connected and/or how long this chart has been open?
.Design</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Hickâ€™s Law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. Peloton recognizes this and uses a few techniques to counter this. When response times are most critical, they minimize choices. After a workout is complete, Peloton suggests a few cool down/post-workout class options for users to click quickly and efficiently after a workout without spending the time trying to select one of the many options for a post-workout</p>
<hr>
<p>Peak-End Rule. This states that people judge an experience based largely on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than an average of how they felt throughout the entire experience. Peloton has placed most emphasis on the peak and end of the userâ€™s journey. At the most intense point of the user journey, you are partaking in a class which is the most enjoyable part of the journey. At its end, you receive a reward for doing your personal best or making any achievements</p>
<hr>
<p>Goal-Gradient effect states that the closer you get to a goal, the higher the tendency to approach that goal. Peloton employs two features to encourage users to complete more workouts in relation to this principle. The display of artificial progress helps ensure users will have more motivation to complete tasks. The progress bar at the top of the screen during a workout is broken down into segments, showing you when youâ€™ve hit certain milestones</p>
