<h2 id=highlights>Highlights</h2>
<hr>
<p>any improvement in the way we organise the everyday writing, how we take notes of what we encounter and what we do with them, will make all the difference for the moment we do face the blank page/screen – or rather not, as those who take smart notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=136" rel=noopener>Location 136</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic and wonder why there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=143" rel=noopener>Location 143</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Just having it all in your head is not enough, as getting it down on paper is the hard bit. That is why good, productive writing is based on good note-taking. Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=155" rel=noopener>Location 155</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=166" rel=noopener>Location 166</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>It is not so important who you are, but what you do. Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, to success. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=169" rel=noopener>Location 169</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Self-discipline or self-control is not that easy to achieve with willpower alone. Willpower is, as far as we know today,[2] a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=172" rel=noopener>Location 172</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=179" rel=noopener>Location 179</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Planners are also unlikely to continue with their studies after they finish their examinations. They are rather glad it is over. Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=212" rel=noopener>Location 212</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>In fact, poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor students lack insight into their own limitations – as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison. (

<hr>
<p>It is not about redoing what you have done before, but about changing the way of working from now on. There is really no need to reorganise anything you already have. Just deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them anyway. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=257" rel=noopener>Location 257</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Even the best tool will not improve your productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines the tool is embedded in, (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=264" rel=noopener>Location 264</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=276" rel=noopener>Location 276</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: Some of the best learnings are portable from tool to tool.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>There is no point in having great tools if they don’t fit together. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=298" rel=noopener>Location 298</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, it&rsquo;s better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=374" rel=noopener>Location 374</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). (

<hr>
<p>Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=416" rel=noopener>Location 416</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=449" rel=noopener>Location 449</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=491" rel=noopener>Location 491</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: So that you can refer back to them in the future</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=497" rel=noopener>Location 497</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: This may be the next step beyond the highlighting i&rsquo;m doing now</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box – it only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=521" rel=noopener>Location 521</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=525" rel=noopener>Location 525</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=543" rel=noopener>Location 543</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>It is public because in the discussion, it does not matter anymore what the author meant, only what is there in writing. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=715" rel=noopener>Location 715</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: What you meant becomes irrelevant.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=737" rel=noopener>Location 737</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: This is a stupid example, but i realized i was bad at wall shots so now i warm up with wall shots. I have hit a few these last few weeks as a result.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=738" rel=noopener>Location 738</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=797" rel=noopener>Location 797</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=804" rel=noopener>Location 804</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in the reference system or, written as if for print, in the slip-box. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=806" rel=noopener>Location 806</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=810" rel=noopener>Location 810</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Only if the notes of these three categories are kept separated it will be possible to build a critical mass of ideas within the slip-box. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=812" rel=noopener>Location 812</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>He always carries a notebook with him and often makes a few quick notes during a conversation. The advantage is obvious: No idea ever gets lost. The disadvantages are serious, though: As he treats every note as if it belongs to the “permanent” category, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=816" rel=noopener>Location 816</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else. When you are in a conversation, listening to a lecture, hear something noteworthy or an idea pops into your mind while you are running errands, a quick note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of doing. That might even apply to reading, if you want to focus on a text without interrupting your reading flow. Then you might want to just underline sentences or write short comments in the margins. It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=838" rel=noopener>Location 838</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: TickTick shoukd be my repo for fleeting notes that i then need to process into permanent notes</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=844" rel=noopener>Location 844</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=848" rel=noopener>Location 848</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>That is why the threshold to write an idea down has to be as low as possible, but it is equally crucial to elaborate on them within a day or two. A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal. In the first case, you forgot what it was supposed to remind you of. In the second case, you forgot the context that gave it its meaning. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=850" rel=noopener>Location 850</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: I have felt this way about tasks in TickTick, but usually less so with highlights</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Luhmann never underlined sentences in the text he read or wrote comments in the margins. All he did was take brief notes about the ideas that caught his attention in a text on a separate piece of paper: “I make a note with the bibliographic details. On the backside I would write ‘on page x is this, on page y is that,’ and then it goes into the bibliographic slip-box where I collect everything I read.” (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=856" rel=noopener>Location 856</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: The fact that i read in the bed makes this challenging.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=866" rel=noopener>Location 866</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>But if we feel constantly stuck in our work, we will become demotivated and much more likely to procrastinate, leaving us with fewer positive or even bad experiences like missed deadlines. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=992" rel=noopener>Location 992</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: This is a bit how I feel at work right now.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, or in the more general terms of psychologist Carol Dweck, to grow. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1009" rel=noopener>Location 1009</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Following a circular approach, on the other hand, allows you to implement many feedback loops, which give you the chance to improve your work while you are working on it. It is not just about increasing the number of opportunities to learn, but also to be able to correct the mistakes we inevitably make. As the feedback loops are usually smaller than one big chunk of feedback at the end, they are also much less scary and easier to embrace. (

<p>Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words. (

<p>Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information. That makes it easier not only to learn and remember, but also to retrieve the information later in the moment and context it is needed. (

<p>Multitasking is not what we think it is. It is not focusing attention on more than one thing at a time. Nobody can do that. When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. And every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment we manage to get focused again. (

<p>When we proofread a manuscript, we take on the role of a critic who takes a step back to see the text with the eyes of a dispassionate reader.

<p>Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus, researchers on expertise, have a simple explanation: Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow (their) rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations. Unlike the expert paramedics, they did not look at the unique circumstances and check if the paramedics in the videos did the best thing possible in each individual situation. Instead, they focused on the question of whether the people in the videos acted according to the rules they taught. (

<p>Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance. But thanks to Zeigarnik’s follow-up research, we also know that we don’t actually have to finish tasks to convince our brains to stop thinking about them. All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of. (

<p>Translating means to give the truest possible account of the original work, using different words – it does not mean the freedom to make something fit.

<p>Different independent studies indicate that writing by hand facilitates understanding. In a small but fascinating study, two psychologists tried to find out if it made a difference if students in a lecture took notes by hand or by typing them into their laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). They were not able to find any difference in terms of the number of facts the students were able to remember. But in terms of understanding the content of the lecture, the students who took their notes by hand came out much, much better. After a week, this difference in understanding was still clearly measurable. (

<p>Handwriting is slower and can’t be corrected as quickly as electronic notes. Because students can’t write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. But to be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in the first place. So if you are writing by hand, you are forced to think about what you hear (or read) (
