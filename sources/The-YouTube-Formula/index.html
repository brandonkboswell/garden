Say things like, “Don&rsquo;t miss the bonus tip at the end of the video,” not, “That&rsquo;s it for now.” (

For instance, I watch all videos at 2× speed. So on a 10:00 video, my AVD would be 5:00, but my AVP would be 100%. For long‐term channel growth, these two metrics are key. The title and thumbnail will get you views, but AVD and AVP will get you Watch time and the right kind of audience. (

The AVPV is the average number of times a viewer watched any video on your channel (in channel analytics) or this particular video (

For tags, use your primary and secondary keywords and other relevant words. Stay under 300 characters in your tags. TubeBuddy is a great tool to show you relevant tags based on your current video&rsquo;s content. (

This is super important because if your impressions have gone up, it means the AI is pushing your video to a broader audience. (

Let your content simmer, and see what it does. But if your CTR is low and your Impressions are average or below, it&rsquo;s time to adjust in real time. You need to change a thumbnail or title now. I recommend switching out your thumbnail first (

The same thing happened with another client: he uploaded a video, and it just wasn&rsquo;t performing well. He waited two days before changing the thumbnail, and the video did pick up, but if he had changed out the thumbnail two hours after upload instead of two days, it would have done so much better. (

Then go to where you lose viewers in the video or where there is more engagement in the video and try to find a pattern for why that is happening at that point in your video (
