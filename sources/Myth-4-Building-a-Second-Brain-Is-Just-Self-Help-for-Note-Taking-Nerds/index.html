<p>Speaker 0: Oh, this one you get excited about, People say that building a <em>second brain</em> is about self improvement, but why is that a myth?
Speaker 1: In some ways it is right. When the book comes out, it will most likely be in the <em>self improvement</em> section. You know, it&rsquo;s about being more effective at life having better results, um being less stressed and doing more with less right productivity, if (

<p>Speaker 1: constraints and deadlines and priorities and things, but just to wake up and do what we feel like, think about what we feel like pursue whatever calls to us, whatever inspires us, right? So to me that I&rsquo;m already anticipating like <em>retirement</em> or just in the future and thinking, okay, if I&rsquo;m going to have nothing on my mind, I need to start preparing for that, I need to start outsource instead of taking on all the responsibility to myself, doing all the kinds of thinking myself. How can I already start delegating? You know, the most basic kinds of thinking to start to machines, to computers so that over time I can have less on my mind instead of more.
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the (

<p>Speaker 0: what it&rsquo;s good at, which is remembering and you&rsquo;re focused on what you&rsquo;re good at, which is open ended thinking.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great point. It&rsquo;s another parallel to <em>Finance</em>. You know, I never wanted to think about my finances budget save because I thought, oh, that&rsquo;s for retirement, decades from now. But then when you go through really looking at your finances, the benefits are instantaneous. You right away once you start budgeting, let&rsquo;s say, start having <em>less stress</em>. You know, where your money is coming from, where it&rsquo;s stored, where it&rsquo;s going. You make better decisions, you&rsquo;re less impulsive, you have just a greater sense of security. So it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re using that the future projection to make changes that benefit you right now. (

<p>Speaker 1: interesting is it&rsquo;s stuff that is first kind of beneath them and they know it it&rsquo;s stuff that anyone could do, right? It&rsquo;s stuff that doesn&rsquo;t add that much value. And it&rsquo;s stuff that is very routine and repeatable, answering emails, scheduling things, you know, uh summarizing their reading, writing up reports or plans or agendas. It&rsquo;s like this kind of just bread and butter of knowledge work that is the perfect target for stuff like the stuff that you want to delegate to your second brain. How can you turn those repeatable low value activities into <em>notes</em>, into <em>checklists</em>, into <em>templates</em>, into <em>models</em>, into things that don&rsquo;t require you to reinvent them from scratch each time that you can just access the results of your past thinking. Speaker 0: I think one of the things that&rsquo;s such a deep assumption is that in order to achieve more we need to work harder. We need to expel more energy. We need to grind and stuff like that. But what a second brain is is it&rsquo;s about one time actions that have multi time benefits.
Speaker 1: Exactly compounding again finance right? (
