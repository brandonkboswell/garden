<hr>
<p>Start by asking for criticism, not by giving it Don’t dish it out before you show you can take it (

<p>Bosses get Radically Candid guidance from their teams not merely by being open to criticism but by actively soliciting it. If a person is bold enough to criticize you, do not critique their criticism. If you see somebody criticizing a peer inappropriately, say something. But if somebody criticizes you inappropriately, your job is to listen with the intent to understand and then to reward the candor. (

<p>My previous experience in such meetings in other countries had been that if I asked a question like, “What could I do or stop doing that would make your lives better?” and then counted to six in my head, somebody would say something. (

<p>JOBS: The most important thing I think you can do for somebody who’s really good and who’s really being counted on is to point out to them when they’re not—when their work isn’t good enough. And to do it very clearly and to articulate why … and to get them back on track. (

<p>though: for criticism to be effective, it’s crucial “to do it very clearly and to articulate why … and to get them back on track.” (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P9LPXPT&location=1064" rel=noopener>Location 1064</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>JOBS: You need to do that in a way that does not call into question your confidence in their abilities but leaves not too much room for interpretation … and that’s a hard thing to do. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P9LPXPT&location=1068" rel=noopener>Location 1068</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Be humble, helpful, offer guidance in person and immediately, praise in public, criticize in private, and don’t personalize. Make it clear that the problem is not due to some unfixable personality flaw. Share stories when you’ve been criticized for something similar. (
<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P9LPXPT&location=1082" rel=noopener>Location 1082</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>JOBS: I don’t mind being wrong. And I’ll admit that I’m wrong a lot. It doesn’t really matter to me too much. What matters to me is that we do the right thing. (

<p>Let’s say you decide to overcome the awkwardness and speak up. You know Alex will be embarrassed when you point out the zipper, but if you say nothing, ten more people will probably see Alex looking ridiculous. So you pull Alex aside and quietly say, “Hey, Alex, your fly is down. I always appreciate when people point it out to me when I’ve done the same thing. I hope you don’t mind my mentioning it.” Your behavior is in the Radical Candor quadrant—both caring personally and challenging directly. (

<p>In order to build a great team, you need to understand how each person’s job fits into their life goals. (

<p>Rock stars are solid as a rock. Think the Rock of Gibraltar, not Bruce Springsteen. The rock stars love their work. They have found their groove. They don’t want the next job if it will take them away from their craft. (

<hr>
<p>Instead of asking an implicitly judgmental question like, “Is this a person with high or low potential?” we encouraged managers to ask themselves questions like, “What growth trajectory does each person on my team want to be on right now?” or “Have I given everybody opportunities that are in line with what they really want?” (
