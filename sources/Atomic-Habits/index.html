<p>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=480" rel=noopener>Location 480</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are. The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=488" rel=noopener>Location 488</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. (

<hr>
<p>If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated. (

<p>How to Create a Good Habit The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying. (

<p>How to Break a Bad Habit Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible. Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying. (

<p>This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.” Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong. (

<p>In the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.) But 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate. The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit. (

<p>Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by his more common possessions. He wrote that there was “no more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of his stuff. Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced his rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to place above the mantel, and a better kitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase led to the next. Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. (

<p>Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don’t know yet. (

<hr>
<p>Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing. (

<hr>
<p>The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Strategies like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1033" rel=noopener>Location 1033</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled with doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to grab one every now and then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1058" rel=noopener>Location 1058</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious: If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter. If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand in the middle of the living room. If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack of stationery on your desk. If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and place them in common locations around the house. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1109" rel=noopener>Location 1109</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1116" rel=noopener>Location 1116</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1121" rel=noopener>Location 1121</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watches television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different people can have different memories—and thus different habits—associated with the same place. The good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1131" rel=noopener>Location 1131</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1161" rel=noopener>Location 1161</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. (

<p>If you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1229" rel=noopener>Location 1229</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. In Byrne’s case, he bundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the thing he needed to do). (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1371" rel=noopener>Location 1371</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1410" rel=noopener>Location 1410</a>)</p>

<p>Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1439" rel=noopener>Location 1439</a>)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed increased safety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. As Charles Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.” (

<p>Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together. (

<hr>
<p>Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1484" rel=noopener>Location 1484</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1542" rel=noopener>Location 1542</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to. You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1627" rel=noopener>Location 1627</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Exercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task that drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.” (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1635" rel=noopener>Location 1635</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.” (

<p>Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive. (

<hr>
<p>refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1715" rel=noopener>Location 1715</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>If motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1721" rel=noopener>Location 1721</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing. (

<p>Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1754" rel=noopener>Location 1754</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How many does it take to form a new habit?” That is, how many repetitions are required to make a habit automatic? (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=1768" rel=noopener>Location 1768</a>)</p>

<p>The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. (

<p>Like a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning their workspace to reduce wasted motion, successful companies design their products to automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible. They reduce the number of fields on each form. They pare down the number of clicks required to create an account. They deliver their products with easy-to-understand directions or ask their customers to make fewer choices. (

<p>People often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. (

<p>Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize. (

<p>Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by specifically writing less than he felt like. He always stopped journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said. (

<p>Becoming an Early Riser Phase 1: Be home by 10 p.m. every night. Phase 2: Have all devices (TV, phone, etc.) turned off by 10 p.m. every night. Phase 3: Be in bed by 10 p.m. every night (reading a book, talking with your partner). Phase 4: Lights off by 10 p.m. every night. Phase 5: Wake up at 6 a.m. every day. (

<p>A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2060" rel=noopener>Location 2060</a>)</p>

<p>Reframe your mind-set. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits. (

<hr>
<p>The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. (

<hr>
<p>It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it. Buying a new jacket is fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t work if you’re trying to budget and save money. (

<hr>
<p>The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit. (

<p>To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. (

<p>If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible. Missing one workout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row. Maybe I’ll eat an entire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy meal. I can’t be perfect, but I can avoid a second lapse. (
<a target=“_blank” href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=2421" rel=noopener>Location 2421</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. (

<p>Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. (

<p>In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net. After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore. (

<p>But this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. (

<p>But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur. (

<p>Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. (

<p>I know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong. (

<p>Each December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more.* Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three questions: What went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What did I learn? (

<p>My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions: What are the core values that drive my life and work? How am I living and working with integrity right now? How can I set a higher standard in the future? (

<p>When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle. Lose that one thing and you lose yourself. (

<p>“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and creates things.” (

<p>The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors. (

<p>Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying. (
