That’s a long and hard process.
Once you’ve exported your highlights, review them and highlight, once again, the parts of those highlights that are the most interesting. … Look at the highlights of your highlights and re-write the interesting ones in your own words.
Next, I have a link back to the literature note from which I wrote this permanent note. That looks like this: We can link permanent notes from literature notes, so we can see in backlinks where it’s coming from....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Decoding/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Day-7-My-System-for-Effortless-Consistency-on-YouTube-brandonkboswell@gmail.com-Gmail/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>Day 7 🤝 My System for Effortless Consistency on YouTube - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</h3><p>Metadata Author: Ali Abdaal Full Title: Day 7: 🤝 My System for Effortless Consistency on YouTube - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail Category: URL: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzGljlgZCjTGRGFjpJshzMGbkfst Highlights One thing stronger than the desire to procrastinate may just be the embarrassment of not sticking to a promised schedule.

And it’s not glamorous. Pick a schedule and stick to it. Religiously. There’s so many reasons to do this. Firstly, the YouTube algorithm favours consistent, regular creators. And you always want the algorithm on your side. Secondly, you want someone to come to your channel and see a consistent backlog of content - if your last video is from 3 months ago and the one before that from 2018, it’s very very unlikely they’ll subscribe....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Day-5-%EF%B8%8F-What-It-Takes-to-Succeed-on-YouTube-brandonkboswell@gmail.com-Gmail/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Day-4-5-Technique-Tips-to-Master-Speaking-to-a-Camera/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>Day 4 🤹 5 Technique Tips to Master Speaking to a Camera</h3><p>Day 4: 🤹 5 Technique Tips to Master Speaking to a Camera Metadata Author: Ali Abdaal Full Title: Day 4: 🤹 5 Technique Tips to Master Speaking to a Camera Highlights So a good compromise that I use is the bullet pointed script. I have a good idea of what I’m talking about and what to include, but I’m not constrained word for word, and that way I can be myself. ( View Highlight)

I never paint myself as someone who’s figured it all out and is spreading his wisdom (the Guru).
