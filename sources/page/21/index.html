Sure, it’s a bit of a reach to say that my written notes are better for preserving my thoughts—if they got lost or burned down, then it’s all gone. What I’m talking about here is the written note’s capacity to encapsulate “what really happened” during the time I thought about a particular idea....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Thinking-With-Pen-and-Paper/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Thinking-Through-Time-A-Conversation-With-Dan-Pink/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>Thinking Through Time A Conversation With Dan Pink</h3><p>Thinking Through Time: A Conversation With Dan Pink Metadata Author: Steven Johnson Full Title: Thinking Through Time: A Conversation With Dan Pink URL: https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/thinking-through-time-a-conversation-with-dan-pink-473b2e7fa0a8?source=rss-c6ea6c1e66f6------2 Highlights 2. Scrutinize your past self. One of my favorite exercises is the failure resumé, which I learned about from Tina Seelig at Stanford University. Many of us labor endlessly on our resumés, scrubbing and buffing them until they shine. That’s cool. The marketing department has a job to do. But the research and development department is feeling a little left out. So, when you’re done Turtle-Waxing your LinkedIn Profile, try Tina’s technique. Compile all your failures, screwups, missteps and blunders....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Thinking-Through-Time-A-Conversation-With-Dan-Pink/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Think-With-Paper-and-Store-Conclusions-Digitally-Decoding/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>Think With Paper and Store Conclusions Digitally – Decoding</h3><p>Metadata Author: Zsolt Benke Full Title: Think With Paper and Store Conclusions Digitally – Decoding URL: https://decoding.io/2021/05/think-with-paper-and-store-conclusions-digitally/ Highlights You can use paper to get an order in random ideas by doing doodles, wireframes, mindmaps, diagrams, or what have you. Because of its tactile feel and freeform nature, paper is a better tool for organizing your thoughts. #status/review
Digital tools make information easier to search, so they are great to store the results of your thinking that you unraveled using paper. Unlike paper, digital tools are rigid, so they are not the most optimal way to support thinking. #status/review</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Think-With-Paper-and-Store-Conclusions-Digitally-Decoding/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/These-Questions-Are-Changing-My-Life-brandonkboswell@gmail.com-Gmail/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>These Questions Are Changing My Life - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</h3><p>Metadata Full Title: These Questions Are Changing My Life - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail URL: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzGmvBnThKNpwmjQKjvPvNfqKsvf Highlights The Kickstart Question: What’s on your mind? This gets to the heart of the conversation. It’s another way of saying let’s talk about the thing that matters most. The person we’re talking to will be relieved on multiple levels: a) we’ve skipped the small talk b) we’re letting them immediately address the main issue c) they’re being listened to. #status/review A good way for us to deepen the conversation (once we’ve discovered the main problem), is to ask which one of the three P’s they’d like to discuss: a) Project - the technical content of their problem....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/These-Questions-Are-Changing-My-Life-brandonkboswell@gmail.com-Gmail/>Read More</a></p></a></div></div><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/sources/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/sources/page/20/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/sources/page/19/ aria-label="Page 19" class=page-link role=button>19</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/sources/page/20/ aria-label="Page 20" class=page-link role=button>20</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 21" class=page-link role=button>21</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/sources/page/22/ aria-label="Page 22" class=page-link role=button>22</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/sources/page/23/ aria-label="Page 23" class=page-link role=button>23</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/sources/page/22/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/sources/page/23/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></div></div><div class=footer><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made with ♥ in Richmond, VA<br>© 2023 Brandon Boswell</p><ul><li><a href=/blog/ target=_blank>Blog</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/brandonkboswell target=_blank>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://youtube.com/brandonkboswell target=_blank>YouTube</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brandonkboswell target=_blank>Github</a></li><li><a href=mailto:brandonkboswell@gmail.com target=_blank>Email</a></li><li><a href=/index.xml target=_blank>RSS</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
