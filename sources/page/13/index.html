( Location 136)
If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic and wonder why there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/How-to-Set-Default-Properties-in-Figma-to-Speed-Up-Your-Workflow-by-Bennorthrup-Bootcamp/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>How to Set Default Properties in Figma to Speed Up Your Workflow by Bennorthrup Bootcamp</h3><p>Metadata Author: bootcamp.uxdesign.cc Full Title: How to Set Default Properties in Figma to Speed Up Your Workflow | by Bennorthrup | Bootcamp Category: URL: https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/how-to-set-default-properties-in-figma-to-speed-up-your-workflow-ab32cccd0117?cmdid=6TTBXTOIV6SMUD Highlights Thankfully, we can say goodbye to the default gray. In fact, not only can you just say goodbye to the gray, you can set any number of different properties as default. The default properties can be entirely defined by you. The process is to create an object, set that object’s properties as you desire them, then top-left menu->Edit->Set Default Properties.

Don’t be afraid to promote your work more than once. The self-retweet has sparked years of Internet debate, but when you’re a writer and simply want to give your content more exposure, there’s no shame in it. Social platforms’ algorithms are designed to constantly update and attempt to match users with posts that will spark their interest.
