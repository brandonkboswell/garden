<p>Thiago, tell me about borrowed creativity. Borrowed creativity is the idea that creativity doesn&rsquo;t come from nothing. It doesn&rsquo;t just emerge from the void. Ah, in some mysterious kind of unexplainable process, it comes from somewhere all creativity is remixed. All of it is translated or repurposed from somewhere. Ah, and this is really something that I that I noticed growing up with artists. His parents. My dad is a painter, always has been a painter since he was three years old. My mom is a A really talented musician, and what I noticed is that they they had this constant consumption, this constant input of (

<p>knowledge. You&rsquo;re shifting it like a Rubik&rsquo;s Cube, looking at it in a new way, and then that becomes the creativity. And it&rsquo;s not trying to sit in a room just quietly and letting a new idea emerge. I have a theory. I think you&rsquo;re absolutely right. And I have a theory why this is so hard for people. Think about what we were taught in school. No cheating. That was the sacrosanct, the most the most important rule in school. Well heard stories. Oh, did you hear about so and so in class number three who cheated? And now he has something on his permanent record he might not get in the college. Basically, his life was ruined because he cheated. But look at what? (

Oh, did you hear about so and so in class number three who cheated? And now he has something on his permanent record he might not get in the college. Basically, his life was ruined because he cheated. But look at what? How cheating was defined in school it was using. It was drawing on someone else&rsquo;s work, right? You weren&rsquo;t allowed to borrow. You weren&rsquo;t allowed to copy. You weren&rsquo;t allowed to emulate everything had to be original. But then, even during research like you&rsquo;re writing a paper, an essay or something, you can borrow sources, but they have to be the most kind of the most basic sources, the most raw sources. So then, in our professional as we do that right, we don&rsquo;t want to take, say, we don&rsquo;t borrow from a a fully design website. But in the professional world, that&rsquo;s exactly what you want to borrow. You want to borrow the most refined, the most distilled, most advanced pieces of work because something like a like a very well designed website has so much thinking that&rsquo;s gone into it. It&rsquo;s such a dense kind of intellectual artifact. You want to take that now Don&rsquo;t take literally like the name of the website that trademarked brand. But if you just go just a little bit before that and take kind of the essence of the thinking that&rsquo;s been done, you can save, I mean countless hours of work. So tell me, what does it (
