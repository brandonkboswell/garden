I grew up in a very small town and we only had dial up internet, but I had an excellent communications teacher, Tracy Wainwright who taught English, Yearbook, Advanced Comm (Morning News) and Newspaper. I wasn't a fan of English, but I loved Yearbook and Advanced Comm. It was in her Yearbook class that I began using Adobe Photoshop, InDesign \u0026 Illustrator. \n* I got pretty decent in those and started creating my own form of awful high school digital art and told my Mom and I wanted to go to art school. She talked me out if it and convinced me to go to business school for Marketing. Effectively the same field but from the opposite end of the table. \n* While in college I worked in a local print shop and that was where I actually got good with the Adobe suite. One of our largest customers at the print shop was Virginia Women's Center, the main OBGYN group in Richmond. They would constantly order business cards and all of the cards followed a standard template. \n* The marketing lead would send us the information for the business card and we would update the business card and send them a proof. They would approve it and then we would print it. \n* I found myself spending so much time just doing this process, so I decided I would see if I could automate this. This was my path to engineering. \n* I wrote a web application where they could add their employee roster and the information for the business card and a script in InDesign that could talk to that API ingest that information to XML and apply that XML to the template. \n* Fast forward a few years. I finish my MBA...\n* After finishing my Master's program, I moved from Richmond, VA to DC to be involved in the startup scene. I was involved in a startup at the 1776 Incubator in DC. That's how I met David Fairbrothers, Dorsata CEO. One evening when my first startup was coming to a close I had David show me what he and Greg Herrington were planning for Dorsata. \n* We saw all of these exciting apps being built for consumer use cases, but healthcare was not part of this. Why could we have these highly polished workflows for posting what we ate for dinner, but Doctors are forced to use what is essentially a Microsoft Access Database for managing the care of 1000's of people.

Record in a small, quiet room\n\nRecord in the smallest and quietest room possible to reduce outside noise and echoes. Shut windows and doors, turn off noise-making machines or devices, and put pets out of the room. Fill your recording space with soft items (couches, pillows, carpet, etc.) to muffle any errant noises. \n\n2. Keep your body still\n\nMoving your body around creates background noise while recording. This happens a lot if you use earbud headphones. The wire lays close to your chest which causes the microphone to rub against your shirt and collar. Try to stay still in your chair with your feet planted. Avoid moving things around on your desk.\n\n#### Speech\n\n3. Be yourself\n\nYou’re here because we already know you’re a great human and speaker! Don’t worry about “likes” or “ums.” Using filler language like “uhhhh” or “y’know?” is a sign that you’re speaking casually. Try not to keep track of your “like” count.\n\n4. Signal Non-verbally\n\nIn a regular conversation, we can see smiles, frowns, fidgets, and more. That’s hard to do in a podcast! Smiling makes you sound friendly. Vary your vocal inflection. If you are trying to convey a particular emotion — genuine interest! shock! delight! — it really helps.\n\n5. Don’t be afraid to re-do\n\nIf you feel you were unclear, misspoke, or would just like a re-do, you can always say “let me try that again”. You can also always flag it audibly for our editor “Hey Editor, please don’t include that!” either after you’ve said it, or the end of the recording. Your privacy matters.\n\n#### Style\n\n6. Stay aware of time  \n   Given that Moss \u0026 Friends is a 30 minute podcast, consider which stories should take priority, and keep the rest concise.\n\n6. Have fun  \n   Moss and Friends is ultimately a few friends having a chat about the things we care about: healthcare, wellness, and design.

A key thing that kept me from breaking the addiction earlier was the social time I got gaming with my cousin. He and I would play almost every night and that was a major portion of my social interaction. If I was going to stop gaming into the early morning hours each night, I would need to find additional ways to get that social interaction.\n\nI decided to start digital gardening and producing a YouTube channel instead. I still game, but limit it to one or two nights a week.\n\n[Key Reasons People Play Video Games](Key%20Reasons%20People%20Play%20Video%20Games.md)\n\n# References\n\n[Escaping video game addiction Cam Adair at TEDxBoulder](../sources/Escaping%20video%20game%20addiction%20Cam%20Adair%20at%20TEDxBoulder.md)",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.254439309-05:00",title:"If you are struggling with Video Game Addiction, look for ways to get what you are getting out of those video games through other sources"},"/seedlings/If-you-never-review-what-youve-written-was-there-any-benefit-to-writing-it":{content:"# If you never review what you've written, was there any benefit to writing it?\n\n\\#review",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.259678768-05:00",title:"If you never review what you've written, was there any benefit to writing it?"},"/seedlings/If-you-rely-strictly-on-logic-you-will-miss-the-creative-solution":{content:"---\n\n# If you rely strictly on logic you will miss the creative solution",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.142338877-05:00",title:"If you rely strictly on logic you will miss the creative solution"},"/seedlings/If-youre-going-to-take-paper-notes-you-need-to-instill-a-process-where-you-will-revisit-those-notes-and-todos.":{content:"# If you're going to take paper notes, you need to instill a process where you will revisit those notes and todos.\n\n*Creative Thought*\n*reflection*",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.25915674-05:00",title:"If you're going to take paper notes, you need to instill a process where you will revisit those notes and todos"},"/seedlings/Improve-the-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio":{content:"# Improve the Signal to Noise Ratio",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.348773937-05:00",title:"Improve the Signal to Noise Ratio"},"/seedlings/Inboxes-only-work-if-you-trust-how-theyre-drained":{content:"# Inboxes only work if you trust how they're drained\n\n*Creative Thought*",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.361012029-05:00",title:"Inboxes only work if you trust how they're draine"},"/seedlings/Increasing-your-luck":{content:'# Increasing your "luck"',lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.293369828-05:00",title:'Increasing your "luck"'},"/seedlings/Incremental-notes-should-be-organized-based-on-the-date-they-were-taken-to-capture-the-story-of-your-learning-and-progression":{content:"# Incremental notes should be organized based on the date they were taken to capture the story of your learning and progression",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.268356276-05:00",title:"Incremental notes should be organized based on the date they were taken to capture the story of your learning and progression"},"/seedlings/Keep-a-decision-journal-to-reflect-on-the-key-decisions-you-made-and-their-outcomes":{content:"---\n\n# Keep a decision journal to reflect on the key decisions you made and their outcomes\n\n*reflection* \n\nI know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in which they record the major decisions they make each, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be.

For me reading puts me to sleep so reading prior to sleep is a win-win for me.\n\nIt helps my brain explore, but also slow down and often leads to a handful of ideas before relaxing and going to sleep. I can normally tell that I'm ready to sleep when I begin reading the same line multiple times or can't retain what I read. \n\nIf you're going to be staying up late I can't think of many things as productive as reading. \n\nI also find that the quality of my sleep is better. Reading calms me and puts my mind and body into a state that makes it easier to transition into sleep. Reading before bed (at least non-fiction) is almost like *Pre-sleep*.\n\nWhen I was younger I had a routine of masturbating before bed to help go to sleep, but looking back now I think this created some form of hormone that caused me to get worse sleep.

Resources: Do you have the energy to do it?\n1. Priority: Once all of those things have been met then Priority matters.\n\nWhen prioritizing ask yourself two questions:\nWhats the value in getting this done?\nWhat bad will happen if I don't?\n\nIf you aren’t crystal clear on your priorities, climb up the *Horizons of Focus*, especially to *Areas of Focus* to know what you are actually responsible for personally and professionally. Many times people will do that and realize they have things on their projects and next actions lists that are not really their job. If you are not sure what your areas are (most people have 5–7 personally and 5–7 professionally) then maybe it’s time for some updates on that with people you think can help you get clear on that.",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.185454225-05:00",title:"Priorities and GTD"},"/sources/Projects-Over-Categories":{content:"---\n\n# Projects Over Categories\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/0/8/8/e/088e8f2ed927f575/second_brain_podcast_300dpi.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *The Building a Second Brain Podcast*\n* Full Title: Projects Over Categories\n* Category:\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/5e8265e24cc59f6e992e9c0a\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.142293106-05:00",title:"Projects Over Categories"},"/sources/Proper-Title-Case-Figma":{content:"---\n\n# Proper Title Case — Figma\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *a*\n* Full Title: Proper Title Case — Figma\n* URL: https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/776197163275203567/Proper-Title-Case?cmdid=PF68MCA7B7VOPJ\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.403539534-05:00",title:"Proper Title Case — Figma"},"/sources/Quick-Passages":{content:"---\n\n# Quick Passages\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/quick-passages-book-icon.2489c00a3133.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: \n* Full Title: Quick Passages\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.294865735-05:00",title:"Quick Passages"},"/sources/Radical-Candor":{content:"---\n\n# Radical Candor\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MFKXNZVOL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Kim Scott*\n* Full Title: Radical Candor\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.352397042-05:00",title:"Radical Candor"},"/sources/Refactoring-My-GTD-System-part-1-List-Managers-Are-Overcomplicating-Our-Systems-Decoding":{content:"---\n\n# Refactoring My GTD System – part 1: List Managers Are Overcomplicating Our Systems – Decoding\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Zsolt Benke*\n* Full Title: Refactoring My GTD System – part 1: List Managers Are Overcomplicating Our Systems – Decoding\n* URL: https://decoding.io/2021/05/refactoring-my-gtd-system-part-1-list-managers-are-overcomplicating-our-systems/\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.34741964-05:00",title:"Refactoring My GTD System – part 1 List Managers Are Overcomplicating Our Systems – Decoding"},"/sources/Reframing-Discipline-and-Elastic-Habits":{content:"---\n\n# Reframing Discipline and Elastic Habits\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://image.simplecastcdn.com/images/c44db111-b60d-436e-ab63-38c7c3402406/367d2e94-5d6b-4efe-bde6-a14687250e56/3000x3000/1471485029-artwork.jpg?aid=rss_feed)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Developer Tea*\n* Full Title: Reframing Discipline and Elastic Habits\n* Category:\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/60f7ceff1d143a000ec0ed59\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.511620894-05:00",title:"Reframing Discipline and Elastic Habits"},"/sources/Removing-Features-Without-Pissing-Off-Your-Users-And-Why-You-Should-by-Richard-Yang-richard.ux-Oct-2021-UX-Collective":{content:"---\n\n# Removing Features Without Pissing Off Your Users (And Why You Should) | by Richard Yang (@richard.ux) | Oct, 2021 | UX Collective\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article4.6bc1851654a0.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *uxdesign.cc*\n* Full Title: Removing Features Without Pissing Off Your Users (And Why You Should) | by Richard Yang (@richard.ux) | Oct, 2021 | UX Collective\n* Category:\n* URL: https://uxdesign.cc/removing-features-without-pissing-off-your-users-and-why-you-should-19b4ee595e33?cmdid=UVMGVKTGNTRKQC\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.220619561-05:00",title:"Removing Features Without Pissing Off Your Users (And Why You Should)  by Richard Yang (@richard.ux)  Oct, 2021  UX Collective"},"/sources/Respecting-Their-Time-Seths-Blog":{content:"---\n\n# Respecting Their Time | Seth's Blog\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: Respecting Their Time | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/09/respecting-their-time/?cmdid=07IS52AQ1ZO5ZB\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.321055265-05:00",title:"Respecting Their Time  Seth's Blog"},"/sources/Robert-Kiyosaki-Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad-Yordi-Verkroost":{content:"---\n\n# Robert Kiyosaki -

This makes the dashed items stand out quite well despite the fact that the same color pen or pencil may be used.\n\n(Right Arrow): Waiting – (i.e. for another action) — Drawing an arrow pointing to the the item denotes that it is something that is waiting on another action to happen or deliverable.\n\n(Left Arrow): Delegated — Drawing an arrow pointing to the left of the item denotes that it has been delegated (with a note to whom and the date) .\n\n(Triangle): Data Point — Turning the dash into a triangle denotes a data point (a fact or figure you wish to remember for instance).\n\n(Circle) — A circle around any of the above means that it has been carried forward, moved to another list or otherwise changed status – i.e. a “Waiting” item has now become an Action Item elsewhere (with a note about where that item has gone).",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.462095941-05:00",title:"The Dash Plus Syste"},"/sources/The-Design-of-Everyday-Things":{content:"---\n\n# The Design of Everyday Things\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/416Hql52NCL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Don Norman*\n* Full Title: The Design of Everyday Things\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.547724363-05:00",title:"The Design of Everyday Things"},"/sources/The-Goldilocks-Fallacy-Seths-Blog":{content:"---\n\n# The Goldilocks Fallacy | Seth's Blog\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Goldilocks Fallacy | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/09/the-goldilocks-fallacy/?cmdid=SOAFNF1EDGDIKJ\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.508059917-05:00",title:"The Goldilocks Fallacy  Seth's Blog"},"/sources/The-Hedonic-Buffet-Seths-Blog":{content:"---\n\n# The Hedonic Buffet | Seth's Blog\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Hedonic Buffet | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/10/the-hedonic-buffet/\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.369448124-05:00",title:"The Hedonic Buffet  Seth's Blog"},"/sources/The-Lean-Startup":{content:"---\n\n# The Lean Startup\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N-u8AsmdL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Eric Ries*\n* Full Title: The Lean Startup\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.246353579-05:00",title:"The Lean Startup"},"/sources/The-Linear-Oppression-of-Note-Taking-Apps":{content:"---\n\n# The Linear Oppression of Note-Taking Apps\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *maggieappleton.com*\n* Full Title: The Linear Oppression of Note-Taking Apps\n* Category:\n* URL: https://maggieappleton.com/note-oppression\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.191297822-05:00",title:"The Linear Oppression of Note-Taking Apps"},"/sources/The-Miser":{content:"---\n\n# The Miser\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://thumborcdn.acast.com/tFX2_Opp6vHIrt-wevM3gGcp33k=/1500x1500/https://acast-media.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets/07058b20-e537-4225-9c56-3adf0e2a669a/0603d98ddaac6ed6cf2a400f739e4f191e267c3bb61fec4423b43170ad9bafdbbf361d5958ac77593b6e1892fa0f8918632f80dd295a438f1c1d3cd7cfd4f6f5.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Akimbo*\n* Author: *Seth Godin*\n* Full Title: The Miser\n* Category:\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/611cbfac8a89e40010112d1f\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.396677354-05:00",title:"The Miser"},"/sources/The-Next-Big-Idea-Seths-Blog":{content:"---\n\n# The Next Big Idea | Seth's Blog\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Next Big Idea | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-next-big-idea/?cmdid=FXNBOJQW8BIH6Q\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-13T00:43:28.388409305-05:00",title:"The Next Big Idea  Seth's Blog"},"/sources/The-Novelty-Index":{content:"---\n\n# The Novelty Index\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *mail.google.com*\n* Full Title: The Novelty Index -

<p>Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: what you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it. I call this the “freedom multiplier.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=454">Location 454</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Different is better when it is more effective or more fun. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=563">Location 563</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>If everyone is defining a problem or solving it one way and the results are subpar, this is the time to ask, What if I did the opposite? Don’t follow a model that doesn’t work. If the recipe sucks, it doesn’t matter how good a cook you are. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=563">Location 563</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>“Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it “eventually,” just do it and correct course along the way. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=611">Location 611</a>)</p>
<hr>
<ol start=5>
<li>Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission. If it isn’t going to devastate those around you, try it and then justify it. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=613">Location 613</a>)</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=623">Location 623</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Eustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for “healthy,” is used in the same sense in the word “euphoria.” Role models who push us to exceed our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth.

<p>Then a funny thing happened. In my undying quest to make myself miserable, I accidentally began to backpedal. As soon as I cut through the vague unease and ambiguous anxiety by defining my nightmare, the worst-case scenario, I wasn’t as worried about taking a trip. Suddenly, I started thinking of simple steps I could take to salvage my remaining resources and get back on track if all hell struck at once.

<p>Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all.

<p>If you look at my chronology, it is obvious that this didn’t happen until a meltdown forced it, despite the requisite income. Why? The goal wasn’t specific enough. I hadn’t defined alternate activities that would replace the initial workload. Therefore, I just continued working, even though there was no financial need. I needed to feel productive and had no other vehicles. This is how most people work until death: “I’ll just work until I have X dollars and then do what I want.” If you don’t define the “what I want” alternate activities, the X figure will increase indefinitely to avoid the fear-inducing uncertainty of this void.

<p>Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it’s six days of making a mountain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end product of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus.

<p>If you haven’t identified the mission-critical tasks and set aggressive start and end times for their completion, the unimportant becomes the important. Even if you know what’s critical, without deadlines that create focus, the minor tasks forced upon you (or invented, in the case of the entrepreneur) will swell to consume time until another bit of minutiae jumps in to replace it, leaving you at the end of the day with nothing accomplished.

If you’re running around like a chicken with its head cut off and assign your VA to do that for you, it doesn’t improve the order of the universe.

<p>Commit to memory the following—never use the new hire. Prohibit small-operation VAs from subcontracting work to untested freelancers without your written permission. The more established and higher-end firms, Brickwork in the below example, have security measures that border on excessive and make it simple to pinpoint abusers in the case of a breach: (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=2197">Location 2197</a>)</p>

<p>Sentences should have one possible interpretation and be suitable for a 2nd-grade reading level. This goes for native speakers as well and will make requests clearer.

<p>This brings us again to damage control. Request a status update after a few hours of work on a task to ensure that the task is both understood and achievable.

<p>Use Parkinson’s Law and assign tasks that are to be completed within no more than 72 hours. I have had the best luck with 48 and 24 hours.

<li>Which social, industry, and professional groups do you belong to, have you belonged to, or do you understand, whether dentists, engineers, rock climbers, recreational cyclists, car restoration aficionados, dancers, or other? Look creatively at your resume, work experience, physical habits, and hobbies and compile a list of all the groups, past and present, that you can associate yourself with. Look at products and books you own, include online and offline subscriptions, and ask yourself, “What groups of people purchase the same?” Which magazines, websites, and newsletters do you read on a regular basis?

<p>Use Writer’s Market to identify magazine options outside the bookstores. Narrow the groups from question 1 above to those that are reachable through one or two small magazines. It’s not important that these groups all have a lot of money (e.g., golfers)—only that they spend money (amateur athletes, bass fishermen, etc.) on products of some type. Call these magazines, speak to the advertising directors, and tell them that you are considering advertising; ask them to e-mail their current advertising rate card and include both readership numbers and magazine back-issue samples. Search the back issues for repeat advertisers who sell direct-to-consumer via 800 numbers or websites—the more repeat advertisers, and the more frequent their ads, the more profitable a magazine is for them … and will be for us.

<p>It Should Cost the Customer $50–200. The bulk of companies set prices in the midrange, and that is where the most competition is. Pricing low is shortsighted, because someone else is always willing to sacrifice more profit margin and drive you both bankrupt. Besides perceived value, there are three main benefits to creating a premium, high-end image and charging more than the competition.

<p>Round-the-World FAQ (includes travel insurance) (<a href=http://www.perpetualtravel.com/rtw>www.perpetualtravel.com/rtw</a>) This FAQ is a lifesaver. Originally written by Marc Brosius, it has been added to by newsgroup participants for years and now covers nuts and bolts from financial planning to return culture shock and all in between. How long can you afford to be away? Do you need travel insurance? Leave of absence or resignation? This is an around-the-world almanac.

<p>But there’s more! Retirees get depressed for a second reason, and you will too: social isolation. Offices are good for some things: free bad coffee and complaining thereof, gossip and commiserating, stupid video clips via e-mail with even stupider comments, and meetings that accomplish nothing but kill a few hours with a few laughs. The job itself might be a dead end, but it’s the web of human interactions—the social environment—that keeps us there. Once liberated, this automatic tribal unit disappears, which makes the voices in your head louder.

<p>As tempting as it is to “just check e-mail for one minute,” I didn’t do it. I know from experience that any problem found in the inbox will linger in the brain for hours or days after you shut down the computer, rendering “free time” useless with preoccupation. It’s the worst of states, where you experience neither relaxation nor productivity. Be focused on work or focused on something else, never in-between.

<p>Favorite reads of 2008: Zorba the Greek and Seneca: Letters from a Stoic. These are two of the most readable books of practical philosophies I’ve ever had the fortune to encounter.

<p>Don’t accept large or costly favors from strangers. This karmic debt will come back to haunt you. If you can’t pass it up, immediately return to karmic neutrality with a gift of your choosing. Repay it before they set the terms for you. Exceptions: über-successful mentors who are making introductions and not laboring on your behalf.

<p>Slow meals = life. From Daniel Gilbert of Harvard to Martin Seligman of Princeton, the “happiness” (self-reported well-being) researchers seem to agree on one thing: Mealtime with friends and loved ones is a direct predictor of well-being. Have at least one 2-to-3-hour dinner and/or drinks per week—yes, 2–3 hours—with those who make you smile and feel good. I find the afterglow effect to be greatest and longest with groups of five or more. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=5042">Location 5042</a>)</p>

<p>Eat a high-protein breakfast within 30 minutes of waking and go for a 10-to-20-minute walk outside afterward, ideally bouncing a handball or tennis ball.

<p>It’s deliberation—the time we vacillate over and consider each decision—that’s the attention consumer.

<li>Do not agree to meetings or calls with no clear agenda or end time. If the desired outcome is defined clearly with a stated objective and agenda listing topics/questions to cover, no meeting or call should last more than 30 minutes.

<p>If you don’t prioritize, everything seems urgent and important. If you define the single most important task for each day, almost nothing seems urgent or important. Oftentimes, it’s just a matter of letting little bad things happen (return a phone call late and apologize, pay a small late fee, lose an unreasonable customer, etc.) to get the big important things done.

<p>Once per week, stop putting out fires for an afternoon and run the numbers to ensure you’re placing effort in high-yield areas: What 20% of customers/products/regions are producing 80% of the profit? What are the factors that could account for this? Invest in duplicating your few strong areas instead of fixing all of your weaknesses.
