I grew up in a very small town and we only had dial up internet, but I had an excellent communications teacher, Tracy Wainwright who taught English, Yearbook, Advanced Comm (Morning News) and Newspaper. I wasn't a fan of English, but I loved Yearbook and Advanced Comm. It was in her Yearbook class that I began using Adobe Photoshop, InDesign \u0026 Illustrator. \n* I got pretty decent in those and started creating my own form of awful high school digital art and told my Mom and I wanted to go to art school. She talked me out if it and convinced me to go to business school for Marketing. Effectively the same field but from the opposite end of the table. \n* While in college I worked in a local print shop and that was where I actually got good with the Adobe suite. One of our largest customers at the print shop was Virginia Women's Center, the main OBGYN group in Richmond. They would constantly order business cards and all of the cards followed a standard template. \n* The marketing lead would send us the information for the business card and we would update the business card and send them a proof. They would approve it and then we would print it. \n* I found myself spending so much time just doing this process, so I decided I would see if I could automate this. This was my path to engineering. \n* I wrote a web application where they could add their employee roster and the information for the business card and a script in InDesign that could talk to that API ingest that information to XML and apply that XML to the template. \n* Fast forward a few years. I finish my MBA...\n* After finishing my Master's program, I moved from Richmond, VA to DC to be involved in the startup scene. I was involved in a startup at the 1776 Incubator in DC. That's how I met David Fairbrothers, Dorsata CEO. One evening when my first startup was coming to a close I had David show me what he and Greg Herrington were planning for Dorsata. \n* We saw all of these exciting apps being built for consumer use cases, but healthcare was not part of this. Why could we have these highly polished workflows for posting what we ate for dinner, but Doctors are forced to use what is essentially a Microsoft Access Database for managing the care of 1000's of people.

Record in a small, quiet room\n\nRecord in the smallest and quietest room possible to reduce outside noise and echoes. Shut windows and doors, turn off noise-making machines or devices, and put pets out of the room. Fill your recording space with soft items (couches, pillows, carpet, etc.) to muffle any errant noises. \n\n2. Keep your body still\n\nMoving your body around creates background noise while recording. This happens a lot if you use earbud headphones. The wire lays close to your chest which causes the microphone to rub against your shirt and collar. Try to stay still in your chair with your feet planted. Avoid moving things around on your desk.\n\n#### Speech\n\n3. Be yourself\n\nYou’re here because we already know you’re a great human and speaker! Don’t worry about “likes” or “ums.” Using filler language like “uhhhh” or “y’know?” is a sign that you’re speaking casually. Try not to keep track of your “like” count.\n\n4. Signal Non-verbally\n\nIn a regular conversation, we can see smiles, frowns, fidgets, and more. That’s hard to do in a podcast! Smiling makes you sound friendly. Vary your vocal inflection. If you are trying to convey a particular emotion — genuine interest! shock! delight! — it really helps.\n\n5. Don’t be afraid to re-do\n\nIf you feel you were unclear, misspoke, or would just like a re-do, you can always say “let me try that again”. You can also always flag it audibly for our editor “Hey Editor, please don’t include that!” either after you’ve said it, or the end of the recording. Your privacy matters.\n\n#### Style\n\n6. Stay aware of time  \n   Given that Moss \u0026 Friends is a 30 minute podcast, consider which stories should take priority, and keep the rest concise.\n\n6. Have fun  \n   Moss and Friends is ultimately a few friends having a chat about the things we care about: healthcare, wellness, and design. It’s okay to make jokes, laugh, and speak as you would in any conversation with your friends.\\*\\*",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.710448944-05:00",title:"Podcasting Tips for Guests from Moss"},"/Poka-Yoke":{content:"# Poka-Yoke\n\n*Seth Godin*\n\nMistake proofing, or its Japanese equivalent poka-yoke (pronounced PO-ka yo-KAY), is the use of **any automatic device or method that either makes it impossible for an error to occur** or makes the error immediately obvious once it has occurred.",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.7349747-05:00",title:"Poka-Yoke"},"/Polymath":{content:"# Polymath\n\nA polymath is **a person who knows a lot about a lot of subjects**.

Instead of me managing my windows manually, what if they could management themselves.\n* I liked the idea of this, but found it to be a bit unreliable in the MacOS Monterrey Beta which I was running and started trying to troubleshoot it.

For me reading puts me to sleep so reading prior to sleep is a win-win for me.\n\nIt helps my brain explore, but also slow down and often leads to a handful of ideas before relaxing and going to sleep. I can normally tell that I'm ready to sleep when I begin reading the same line multiple times or can't retain what I read. \n\nIf you're going to be staying up late I can't think of many things as productive as reading. \n\nI also find that the quality of my sleep is better. Reading calms me and puts my mind and body into a state that makes it easier to transition into sleep. Reading before bed (at least non-fiction) is almost like *Pre-sleep*.\n\nWhen I was younger I had a routine of masturbating before bed to help go to sleep, but looking back now I think this created some form of hormone that caused me to get worse sleep.

Resources: Do you have the energy to do it?\n1. Priority: Once all of those things have been met then Priority matters.\n\nWhen prioritizing ask yourself two questions:\nWhats the value in getting this done?\nWhat bad will happen if I don't?\n\nIf you aren’t crystal clear on your priorities, climb up the *Horizons of Focus*, especially to *Areas of Focus* to know what you are actually responsible for personally and professionally. Many times people will do that and realize they have things on their projects and next actions lists that are not really their job. If you are not sure what your areas are (most people have 5–7 personally and 5–7 professionally) then maybe it’s time for some updates on that with people you think can help you get clear on that.",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.746007715-05:00",title:"Priorities and GTD"},"/sources/Projects-Over-Categories":{content:"---\n\n# Projects Over Categories\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/0/8/8/e/088e8f2ed927f575/second_brain_podcast_300dpi.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *The Building a Second Brain Podcast*\n* Full Title: Projects Over Categories\n* Category:\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/5e8265e24cc59f6e992e9c0a\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.724634444-05:00",title:"Projects Over Categories"},"/sources/Quick-Passages":{content:"---\n\n# Quick Passages\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/quick-passages-book-icon.2489c00a3133.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: \n* Full Title: Quick Passages\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.804991488-05:00",title:"Quick Passages"},"/sources/Radical-Candor":{content:"---\n\n# Radical Candor\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MFKXNZVOL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Kim Scott*\n* Full Title: Radical Candor\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.817626709-05:00",title:"Radical Candor"},"/sources/Refactoring-My-GTD-System-part-1-List-Managers-Are-Overcomplicating-Our-Systems-Decoding":{content:"---\n\n# Refactoring My GTD System – part 1: List Managers Are Overcomplicating Our Systems – Decoding\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Zsolt Benke*\n* Full Title: Refactoring My GTD System – part 1: List Managers Are Overcomplicating Our Systems – Decoding\n* URL: https://decoding.io/2021/05/refactoring-my-gtd-system-part-1-list-managers-are-overcomplicating-our-systems/\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.713124516-05:00",title:"Refactoring My GTD System – part 1 List Managers Are Overcomplicating Our Systems – Decoding"},"/sources/Reframing-Discipline-and-Elastic-Habits":{content:"---\n\n# Reframing Discipline and Elastic Habits\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://image.simplecastcdn.com/images/c44db111-b60d-436e-ab63-38c7c3402406/367d2e94-5d6b-4efe-bde6-a14687250e56/3000x3000/1471485029-artwork.jpg?aid=rss_feed)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Developer Tea*\n* Full Title: Reframing Discipline and Elastic Habits\n* Category:\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/60f7ceff1d143a000ec0ed59\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.776218517-05:00",title:"Reframing Discipline and Elastic Habits"},"/sources/Removing-Features-Without-Pissing-Off-Your-Users-And-Why-You-Should-by-Richard-Yang-richard.ux-Oct-2021-UX-Collective":{content:"---\n\n# Removing Features Without Pissing Off Your Users (And Why You Should) | by Richard Yang (@richard.ux) | Oct, 2021 | UX Collective\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article4.6bc1851654a0.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *uxdesign.cc*\n* Full Title: Removing Features Without Pissing Off Your Users (And Why You Should) | by Richard Yang (@richard.ux) | Oct, 2021 | UX Collective\n* Category:\n* URL: https://uxdesign.cc/removing-features-without-pissing-off-your-users-and-why-you-should-19b4ee595e33?cmdid=UVMGVKTGNTRKQC\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.75286837-05:00",title:"Removing Features Without Pissing Off Your Users (And Why You Should)  by Richard Yang (@richard.ux)  Oct, 2021  UX Collective"},"/sources/Respecting-Their-Time-Seths-Blog":{content:"---\n\n# Respecting Their Time | Seth's Blog\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: Respecting Their Time | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/09/respecting-their-time/?cmdid=07IS52AQ1ZO5ZB\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.808162488-05:00",title:"Respecting Their Time  Seth's Blog"},"/sources/Robert-Kiyosaki-Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad-Yordi-Verkroost":{content:"---\n\n# Robert Kiyosaki -

All items, no matter what they are, are therefore treated as items to be processed.\n\n(Plus): Done Action Item — If the item is an action item (todo), when the item is complete, a vertical line is drawn through the “dash” thus making it resemble a “plus”. This makes the dashed items stand out quite well despite the fact that the same color pen or pencil may be used.\n\n(Right Arrow): Waiting – (i.e. for another action) — Drawing an arrow pointing to the the item denotes that it is something that is waiting on another action to happen or deliverable.\n\n(Left Arrow): Delegated — Drawing an arrow pointing to the left of the item denotes that it has been delegated (with a note to whom and the date) .\n\n(Triangle): Data Point — Turning the dash into a triangle denotes a data point (a fact or figure you wish to remember for instance).\n\n(Circle) — A circle around any of the above means that it has been carried forward, moved to another list or otherwise changed status – i.e. a “Waiting” item has now become an Action Item elsewhere (with a note about where that item has gone).",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.886267991-05:00",title:"The Dash Plus Syste"},"/sources/The-Design-of-Everyday-Things":{content:"---\n\n# The Design of Everyday Things\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/416Hql52NCL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Don Norman*\n* Full Title: The Design of Everyday Things\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.699976603-05:00",title:"The Design of Everyday Things"},"/sources/The-Goldilocks-Fallacy-Seths-Blog":{content:"---\n\n# The Goldilocks Fallacy | Seth's Blog\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Goldilocks Fallacy | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/09/the-goldilocks-fallacy/?cmdid=SOAFNF1EDGDIKJ\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.771108246-05:00",title:"The Goldilocks Fallacy  Seth's Blog"},"/sources/The-Hedonic-Buffet-Seths-Blog":{content:"---\n\n# The Hedonic Buffet | Seth's Blog\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Hedonic Buffet | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/10/the-hedonic-buffet/\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.878503443-05:00",title:"The Hedonic Buffet  Seth's Blog"},"/sources/The-Lean-Startup":{content:"---\n\n# The Lean Startup\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N-u8AsmdL._SL200_.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Eric Ries*\n* Full Title: The Lean Startup\n* Category:\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.845790932-05:00",title:"The Lean Startup"},"/sources/The-Linear-Oppression-of-Note-Taking-Apps":{content:"---\n\n# The Linear Oppression of Note-Taking Apps\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article1.be68295a7e40.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *maggieappleton.com*\n* Full Title: The Linear Oppression of Note-Taking Apps\n* Category:\n* URL: https://maggieappleton.com/note-oppression\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.754274642-05:00",title:"The Linear Oppression of Note-Taking Apps"},"/sources/The-Miser":{content:"---\n\n# The Miser\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://thumborcdn.acast.com/tFX2_Opp6vHIrt-wevM3gGcp33k=/1500x1500/https://acast-media.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets/07058b20-e537-4225-9c56-3adf0e2a669a/0603d98ddaac6ed6cf2a400f739e4f191e267c3bb61fec4423b43170ad9bafdbbf361d5958ac77593b6e1892fa0f8918632f80dd295a438f1c1d3cd7cfd4f6f5.jpeg)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *Akimbo*\n* Author: *Seth Godin*\n* Full Title: The Miser\n* Category:\n* URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/611cbfac8a89e40010112d1f\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.82345467-05:00",title:"The Miser"},"/sources/The-Next-Big-Idea-Seths-Blog":{content:"---\n\n# The Next Big Idea | Seth's Blog\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article0.00998d930354.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *seths.blog*\n* Full Title: The Next Big Idea | Seth's Blog\n* Category:\n* URL: https://seths.blog/2021/11/the-next-big-idea/?cmdid=FXNBOJQW8BIH6Q\n\n## Highlights",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.816730713-05:00",title:"The Next Big Idea  Seth's Blog"},"/sources/The-Novelty-Index":{content:"---\n\n# The Novelty Index\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)\n\n## Metadata\n\n* Author: *mail.google.com*\n* Full Title: The Novelty Index -

The audio will be shit and you'll have to use the screen recording audio.\n\n### How to Setup the Loom Style Circle\n\n* Add an ellipse in Fusion and load the stored settings\n* Once back in the Editor set the Zoom to 0.250\n* Set the X Position to -1556 (1650 if you want it docked to the right)\n* Set the Y Position to -767 (for bottom)\n* Crop Right to 58.6 (may not be necessary)\n\n### Video #7\n\n* Don't use a Content timeline as it makes it impossible to use markers\n* You can use a talking head layer above the screenshare+head circle layer to make it easy to do those cuts without a separate timeline\n* You can generate chapters with the markers baked into Davinci Resolve. I should try that next time\n\n*2022-01-16*\n\n* Make sure the desk is low enough that my head fills most of the frame. This will make looking into the camera significantly easier.\n* Try setting the microphone down low and facing upward as that seems to have few background reverberations than having the microphone high and facing down toward a hard surface like the desk\n* I also moved the microphone arm to get it further from my elbows.\n* With the Camlink I can record everything live and that makes things much simpler in editing. I can focus on the content instead of the editing.\n* I was able to record two videos back to back today due to the simplicity and not having the change camera setups for the content vs the intro/outro.\n* Record from Desk height #2 to have better framing and less bumps from supporting yourself on the desk.\n\n*2022-01-28*\n\n* The end card for a video can only be 20 seconds. I should adjust my outro to be 20 seconds.",lastmodified:"2022-02-11T21:22:26.803050521-05:00",title:"Learnings from YouTube Videos"},"/youtube/Pitch":{content:"# Pitch\n\n\"I spend a lot of time with my computer, but I love it.

<p>Before we try to solve a problem with advanced tools, we have to consider using something simpler which can yield the same result. For example, we can use paper to think, but store the result of that thinking in digital tools. Having many features can distract us from work by fiddling with the tool. The importance of a project is not defined by the tool we’re using to administer it. #review</p>
