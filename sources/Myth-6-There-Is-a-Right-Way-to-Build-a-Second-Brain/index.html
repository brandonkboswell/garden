<p>Speaker 1: Why is that a myth?
Speaker 0: I really take issue with a comment that sometimes people say, which is I haven&rsquo;t yet implemented your system actually, it bugs me anytime someone says your system. Because what I hear in that, in that comment is this idea that I have figured out the ultimate perfect way for them to be successful. They need to just perfectly copy and mimic my perfect way and I just couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. I mean, unless they happen to have my exact life circumstances, my exact same temperament and personality, my same learning style, my same goals, unless they are a, a literal clone of me than my system will not be their system.

<p>Speaker 0: and the memory never fades, never goes away, never gets any weaker. Can you imagine? You know? And there&rsquo;s something else too. I mean, that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s an extreme example, but just They they really lose the plot. If you can remember what happened, you know, 30 years ago, the same as yesterday, The level of detail in your head becomes like a noise, nothing gets forgotten, nothing falls away. Everything is front and center. It&rsquo;s like having 50 stereos right in front of you all turned up to maximum volume, right? Um and so I think more and more in the study of the human brain, we&rsquo;re understanding that forgetting is actually a powerful capability and then you go to digital note taking and people are doing everything they can to never ever forget anything ever. Isn&rsquo;t that an interesting paradox? Right? So I&rsquo;m actually curious like I want to know, taking out that has forgetting as a future if you don&rsquo;t access a note or at least you know, change it or edit it or modify or distillate in some way, after a certain period of time it just falls away just gets deleted. And people here that they&rsquo;re like, (

<p>Speaker 0: But doing it now this week, this month.
Speaker 1: So tell me once I get inside of second brain, how do you help me figure out where on these various spectrums I am in terms of thinking very analytically, being a bit more creative in terms of being very high in order, being or being like me a little bit more. Okay with randomness. How do you actually help me figure this out
Speaker 0: to s models and experiments? Okay, so the first is models. The one of the very basic ways that humans learn is just mimicking Before you learn to do something original or originally you have to just copy someone, right? So (

<p>Speaker 1: system. It&rsquo;s a second brain that is my system that works for me. And only once you make the system your own are you really beginning to properly build a second brain?
Speaker 0: The way I see that manifested is sometimes people, you know, six months after they finished the course will write me this very long apologetic email and they&rsquo;ll say, I&rsquo;m really sorry I&rsquo;ve made my own system instead of doing it how you do it. I&rsquo;m going to do it this way. And they have these explanations and again, apologies. And so but I really liked what I learned from you and they think they&rsquo;re like offending me. They think they&rsquo;re like going outside of the official holy doctrine. But what they don&rsquo;t realize is that right? There is the evidence of mastery when you know the rules well enough to break them. You (
