<p>Businesses are good at measuring performance, but bad at measuring trustworthiness.
The Navy Seals think of people in a Performance vs Trust matrix. Ideally you want the high performance, high trust individual, but if you can&rsquo;t have that person you should value high trust over high performing. The high performing, low trust person is toxic to your team. Medium performance individuals can be taught.</p>

<p>The Tickler File is an organizational tool which can be used to simplify the tracking of date-related items and to manage work flow. It works well as an adjunct to personal planners and calendars, allowing them to be used for streamlined focus on items that require on-going review and access.

<p>If you want to be reminded to handle something in the future, but don’t want or need to think about it until then, it can be “tickled” to show up exactly on the day or month you’d like to see it again.</p>

<p><em>Capture Tools</em>
<em>Analog</em>
<em>Handwritten Daily Notes</em>
<em>Tools for thought</em></p>
<p>(Dash): Undone Action Item — Individual items (action items and ideas) are marked with a dash preceding them. All items, no matter what they are, are therefore treated as items to be processed.</p>
<p>(Plus): Done Action Item — If the item is an action item (todo), when the item is complete, a vertical line is drawn through the “dash” thus making it resemble a “plus”. This makes the dashed items stand out quite well despite the fact that the same color pen or pencil may be used.</p>
<p>(Right Arrow): Waiting – (i.e. for another action) — Drawing an arrow pointing to the the item denotes that it is something that is waiting on another action to happen or deliverable.</p>
<p>(Left Arrow): Delegated — Drawing an arrow pointing to the left of the item denotes that it has been delegated (with a note to whom and the date) .</p>
<p>(Triangle): Data Point — Turning the dash into a triangle denotes a data point (a fact or figure you wish to remember for instance).</p>
<p>(Circle) — A circle around any of the above means that it has been carried forward, moved to another list or otherwise changed status – i.e. a “Waiting” item has now become an Action Item elsewhere (with a note about where that item has gone).</p>

<p>Embrace the suck - Whenever I struggle with procrastination (eg writing my book), I lower the bar by telling myself that ‘I just need to write 500 crappy words for a crappy first draft of chapter three’. Repeating ‘crappy’ two times helps to neutralize my inner perfectionist. I always get more done that way, and I’m usually pleasantly surprised by the outcome. #review

<p>1: Eliminate Small Decisions A small decision is something trivial: What to have for breakfast; what to wear; when to begin work; when to take your lunch break; etc. Many of these small decisions can be automated and routinized by deciding in advance&hellip; thus, effectively removing them as unique decisions you make every single day. By automating your small decisions and eliminating them from your life, you can get back your much-needed energy to allow for a greater capacity to focus on the bigger decisions of your day-to-day life and the more challenging problems you are trying to solve. #review</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the most important things in our life happen we quite often do not know, at the moment, what is going on. A man does not always say to himself, &lsquo;Hullo! I&rsquo;m growing up&rsquo; It is often only when he looks back that he realises what has happened and recognises it as what people call &lsquo;growing up.'&rdquo; - C.S. Lewis</p>
<hr>
<p>In Ray Dalio’s book, Principles, he lists a 5-step process for how to make progress on your goals: Identify your goals. Encounter your problems. Diagnose the problems to get to their root cause. Design changes to get around the problems. Do what is needed.</p>

<p>1: Alternative Ways to Spend 5 Minutes of Awkward Downtime Last week, as our latest Focus Academy cohort was wrapping up, one of the members asked in the Slack group about how to spend time during the “down moments” of his work day when there was roughly 5 or 10 minutes with nothing to do. Perhaps you’ve experienced just such an awkward window of time like this — such as in-between Zoom meetings or something. And so, allow me to suggest a few ways to spend those few minutes&hellip; If you Use Day One scroll through your Day One timeline and read a previous journal entry. Browse some old photos and memories. Launch Day One (or any other journal you have) and log how you’ve spent your time so far for the day. Doing this for a few weeks can also be super helpful for getting a perspective of where your time and energy are being spent. Write down 3 new ideas. These could be articles you want to write, business ideas, places you want to visit or photograph, topics you want to research, date ideas for you and your spouse, gift ideas for a friend, etc. These ideas never have to to be acted on — the point isn’t to generate a to-do list, but rather to exercise your mind. Ideation and creativity are muscles, and the more we exercise them the stronger they get. Send a text message to a friend or family member to tell them how awesome they are. Stand up and do some stretching / body movement. #review</p>

<p>I’ve been using Day One as my journal app for about a decade. And, there have certainly been times when I write and journal far less than I would like — sometimes I just don’t have any interest or motivation to write in there. A new approach to journaling that I picked up about a month ago, is something that makes it very easy to create a Day One entry. And, more often than not, it leads me to continue writing. The approach is to simply finish this sentence: “Today was a good day because&hellip;.”. #review</p>

<p>One type of goal is an attainment goal: something with a clear definition of completion that you achieve or accomplish. The other type is a Lifestyle Goal: a habit or routine that you incorporate into your everyday lifestyle. When setting a new goal in your life, knowing which type of goal can help you to succeed in getting to your desired outcome. #review</p>

<p>1: <em>Time Blocks</em> for Your Roles in Life I have a handful of <em>roles</em> in my life that are the most important to me right now: Husband, dad, friend, business owner, writer. And I find that one of the best ways to consistently show up for these roles and maintain them as a priority in my life, is to have blocks of time set aside for them: date night, family dinner, friendship time, writing time, etc.</p>

<p>The best way to be strategic with how you are spending your time and energy is to be clear on your desired outcome, and then pick one thing you think will move you in that direction. Stick with it for long enough to determine if your actions are working. If they are working, keep going. If they are not working, stop and try something new. #review</p>

<p>Theoretical physicist Richard Feynman with some advice for life: &ldquo;Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don&rsquo;t think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn&rsquo;t stop you from doing anything at all.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Different meanings can be assigned to the same events. Look for evidence of how the world is encouraging you, and you will find it. Look for evidence of how the world is burdening you, and you will find it. Choose an explanation that empowers you.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Spend more time searching for better information sources. A body filled with junk food struggles to move well. A mind filled with junk thoughts struggles to think well.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;A quick and easy tip for building habits that last: Pick a standard time and place to do it. It’s easier to wake up knowing &ldquo;I exercise at 4pm&rdquo; than to decide each time when to fit a habit into your day. If it’s already decided, all you need to do is show up.&rdquo;</p>
