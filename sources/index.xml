&lt;p>Businesses are good at measuring performance, but bad at measuring trustworthiness.
The Navy Seals think of people in a Performance vs Trust matrix. Ideally you want the high performance, high trust individual, but if you can&amp;rsquo;t have that person you should value high trust over high performing. The high performing, low trust person is toxic to your team. Medium performance individuals can be taught.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Benefits of Drawing by Hand</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/The-Benefits-of-Drawing-by-Hand/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 13:31:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/The-Benefits-of-Drawing-by-Hand/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>The Tickler File is an organizational tool which can be used to simplify the tracking of date-related items and to manage work flow. It works well as an adjunct to personal planners and calendars, allowing them to be used for streamlined focus on items that require on-going review and access. The Tickler is also referred to as “perpetual file,” “bring-forward file,” “follow-up file,” or “suspense file.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to be reminded to handle something in the future, but don’t want or need to think about it until then, it can be “tickled” to show up exactly on the day or month you’d like to see it again.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>(Dash): Undone Action Item — Individual items (action items and ideas) are marked with a dash preceding them. All items, no matter what they are, are therefore treated as items to be processed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Plus): Done Action Item — If the item is an action item (todo), when the item is complete, a vertical line is drawn through the “dash” thus making it resemble a “plus”. This makes the dashed items stand out quite well despite the fact that the same color pen or pencil may be used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Right Arrow): Waiting – (i.e. for another action) — Drawing an arrow pointing to the the item denotes that it is something that is waiting on another action to happen or deliverable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Left Arrow): Delegated — Drawing an arrow pointing to the left of the item denotes that it has been delegated (with a note to whom and the date) .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Triangle): Data Point — Turning the dash into a triangle denotes a data point (a fact or figure you wish to remember for instance).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Circle) — A circle around any of the above means that it has been carried forward, moved to another list or otherwise changed status – i.e. a “Waiting” item has now become an Action Item elsewhere (with a note about where that item has gone).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Obsidian Kindle Notes Workflow</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/My-Obsidian-Kindle-Notes-Workflow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 13:20:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/My-Obsidian-Kindle-Notes-Workflow/</guid><description>&lt;p>Author: &lt;em>Bryan Jenks&lt;/em>

&lt;p>Embrace the suck - Whenever I struggle with procrastination (eg writing my book), I lower the bar by telling myself that ‘I just need to write 500 crappy words for a crappy first draft of chapter three’. Repeating ‘crappy’ two times helps to neutralize my inner perfectionist. I always get more done that way, and I’m usually pleasantly surprised by the outcome. #review

&lt;p>1: Alternative Ways to Spend 5 Minutes of Awkward Downtime Last week, as our latest Focus Academy cohort was wrapping up, one of the members asked in the Slack group about how to spend time during the “down moments” of his work day when there was roughly 5 or 10 minutes with nothing to do. Perhaps you’ve experienced just such an awkward window of time like this — such as in-between Zoom meetings or something. And so, allow me to suggest a few ways to spend those few minutes&amp;hellip; If you Use Day One scroll through your Day One timeline and read a previous journal entry. Browse some old photos and memories. Launch Day One (or any other journal you have) and log how you’ve spent your time so far for the day. Doing this for a few weeks can also be super helpful for getting a perspective of where your time and energy are being spent. Write down 3 new ideas. These could be articles you want to write, business ideas, places you want to visit or photograph, topics you want to research, date ideas for you and your spouse, gift ideas for a friend, etc. These ideas never have to to be acted on — the point isn’t to generate a to-do list, but rather to exercise your mind. Ideation and creativity are muscles, and the more we exercise them the stronger they get. Send a text message to a friend or family member to tell them how awesome they are. Stand up and do some stretching / body movement. #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2x2 Lists, Lists, Lists.... - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/2x2-Lists-Lists-Lists....-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/2x2-Lists-Lists-Lists....-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="2x2-lists-lists-lists---brandonkboswellgmailcom---gmail">2x2: Lists, Lists, Lists&amp;hellip;. -

&lt;p>I’ve been using Day One as my journal app for about a decade. And, there have certainly been times when I write and journal far less than I would like — sometimes I just don’t have any interest or motivation to write in there. A new approach to journaling that I picked up about a month ago, is something that makes it very easy to create a Day One entry. And, more often than not, it leads me to continue writing. The approach is to simply finish this sentence: “Today was a good day because&amp;hellip;.”. #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>One type of goal is an attainment goal: something with a clear definition of completion that you achieve or accomplish. The other type is a Lifestyle Goal: a habit or routine that you incorporate into your everyday lifestyle. When setting a new goal in your life, knowing which type of goal can help you to succeed in getting to your desired outcome. #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2x2 The Law of Clarity - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/2x2-The-Law-of-Clarity-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/2x2-The-Law-of-Clarity-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Theoretical physicist Richard Feynman with some advice for life: &amp;ldquo;Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don&amp;rsquo;t think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop you from doing anything at all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Different meanings can be assigned to the same events. Look for evidence of how the world is encouraging you, and you will find it. Look for evidence of how the world is burdening you, and you will find it. Choose an explanation that empowers you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Spend more time searching for better information sources. A body filled with junk food struggles to move well. A mind filled with junk thoughts struggles to think well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A quick and easy tip for building habits that last: Pick a standard time and place to do it. It’s easier to wake up knowing &amp;ldquo;I exercise at 4pm&amp;rdquo; than to decide each time when to fit a habit into your day. If it’s already decided, all you need to do is show up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3-2-1 Active Patience, Focusing on What You Can Control, and Playing a Game Worth Winning - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/3-2-1-Active-Patience-Focusing-on-What-You-Can-Control-and-Playing-a-Game-Worth-Winning-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/3-2-1-Active-Patience-Focusing-on-What-You-Can-Control-and-Playing-a-Game-Worth-Winning-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Writer Doris Lessing on how to choose what to read: &amp;ldquo;There is only one way to read, which is to browse in libraries and bookshops, picking up books that attract you, reading only those, dropping them when they bore you, skipping the parts that drag – and never, never reading anything because you feel you ought, or because it is part of a trend or a movement. Remember that the book which bores you when you are twenty or thirty will open doors for you when you are forty or fifty-and vise versa. Don’t read a book out of its right time for you.&amp;rdquo; #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3-2-1 Doubling Your Intelligence, Zooming Out, and Finding Value in Anger - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/3-2-1-Doubling-Your-Intelligence-Zooming-Out-and-Finding-Value-in-Anger-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/3-2-1-Doubling-Your-Intelligence-Zooming-Out-and-Finding-Value-in-Anger-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Three simple ways to get more of what you want in life: 1) Be kind and pleasant to others. 2) Ask for what you want. 3) Follow up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I tell my kids, what is the difference between a hero and a coward? What is the difference between being [cowardly] and being brave? No difference. Only what you do. They both feel the same. They both fear dying and getting hurt. The man who is [cowardly] refuses to face up to what he’s got to face. The hero is more disciplined and he fights those feelings off and he does what he has to do. But they both feel the same, the hero and the coward. People who watch you judge you on what you do, not how you feel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3-2-1 How Friendship Happens, Letting Go, and Revision - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/3-2-1-How-Friendship-Happens-Letting-Go-and-Revision-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/3-2-1-How-Friendship-Happens-Letting-Go-and-Revision-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s better to be alone than to spend time with toxic people. It&amp;rsquo;s better to do nothing than to work on something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. It&amp;rsquo;s better to rest than to climb the wrong mountain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>People who look for reasons why things will work—and solve problems as they arise—make things happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;there is a paradox to scale, I think. People who want to be big sometimes think, &amp;ldquo;I have to immediately reach the largest possible audience.&amp;rdquo; But in a weird way, the best way to produce things that take off is to produce small things. To become a small expert. To become the best person on the internet at understanding the application of Medicaid to minority children, or something like that. And the reason why I think this is true I call my Tokyo example. If you go to Tokyo, you&amp;rsquo;ll see there are all sorts of really, really strange shops. There&amp;rsquo;ll be a shop that&amp;rsquo;s only 1970&amp;rsquo;s vinyl and like, 1980&amp;rsquo;s whisky or something. And that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense if it&amp;rsquo;s a shop in a Des Moines suburb, right? In a Des Moines suburb, to exist, you have to be Subway. You have to hit the mass-market immediately. But in Tokyo, where there&amp;rsquo;s 30-40 million people within a train ride of a city, then your market is 40 million. And within that 40 million, sure, there&amp;rsquo;s a couple thousand people who love 1970&amp;rsquo;s music and 1980&amp;rsquo;s whisky. The Internet is Tokyo. The Internet allows you to be niche at scale.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3-2-1 How to Be Alone, Taking Action, and Choosing Your Heroes - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/3-2-1-How-to-Be-Alone-Taking-Action-and-Choosing-Your-Heroes-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/3-2-1-How-to-Be-Alone-Taking-Action-and-Choosing-Your-Heroes-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Now is the time to get serious about living your ideals. How long can you afford to put off who you really want to be? Your nobler self cannot wait any longer. Put your principles into practice – now. Stop the excuses and the procrastination. This is your life! You aren’t a child anymore. The sooner you set yourself to your spiritual program, the happier you will be. The longer you wait, the more you’ll be vulnerable to mediocrity and feel filled with shame and regret, because you know you are capable of better.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Here’s the thing about your heroes: You have to know about them to look up to them. The candidate pool is 100% limited by your exposure. That’s why so many kids look up to athletes, I think. They haven’t been exposed to enough other people to look up to them. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I think about that: Who haven’t I been exposed to that would inspire me if I knew they existed or knew the details of their lives? And how could I learn about those people?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3-2-1 How to Build a Career in 7 Steps, Paying Attention to Boredom, and Setting Boundaries - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/3-2-1-How-to-Build-a-Career-in-7-Steps-Paying-Attention-to-Boredom-and-Setting-Boundaries-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/3-2-1-How-to-Build-a-Career-in-7-Steps-Paying-Attention-to-Boredom-and-Setting-Boundaries-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Life is easier when you know what you want—but most people don&amp;rsquo;t take the time to figure out what they want. It&amp;rsquo;s not that we are completely lost, but our efforts are often slightly misdirected. People will work for years and ultimately achieve a lifestyle that isn&amp;rsquo;t quite what they were hoping for—often, simply, because they never clearly defined what they wanted. An hour of thinking can save you a decade of work.

&lt;p>Keeping our brain challenged means we need to pursue high-quality leisure as defined by Cal Newport in Digital Minimalism. High-quality leisure has three main components.
First, it involves demanding activity instead of passive consumption. It means not sitting in front of the TV, but doing something that requires effort from you.
Second, high-quality leisure is often working that produces something in the physical world. It’s painting, planting a garden, or fixing bikes. It’s activity away from the digital world.

&lt;p>This now means that jobs expect all your leisure time as well as your work time4. Companies expect you to answer email on the weekends and evenings, but think that you’re a terrible employee if you want to run an errand during the workday. They feel as if any hour you don’t work for them is an hour you stole. #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>One point I agree on is that you must ship8. I’ve talked to many people that want to have courses, or write a book. One big constant is that they never put the time in to doing the work required to accomplish these goals. If you want to write, and spend your evenings watching TV instead of doing the work of writing…you just want to have written. You don’t like writing, you want to be an accomplished author. You love a dream not the process of getting to the dream. #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5 Months of Content in 5 Minutes</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/5-Months-of-Content-in-5-Minutes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/5-Months-of-Content-in-5-Minutes/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Ali Abdaal&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Episode 20 is also another hurdle&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Projects. These are items that are brought together to help achieve a specific goal by a specific date. Notes and tasks can belong to a project. Projects become completed.
Areas (known as Tags in Organizedly). These are notes that have related content. In Organizedly, you use tags to group your notes into areas. In this way, notes can belong to a project and to more than one area.
Resources. (Also called Collections.) Groups of related notes that you want to continue to have access to regardless of project status. Some people call these evergreen notes.
Archive. The place to stow away completed project information on the chance you may want to reference them again in the future, but that are not part of your current work load.
I would add to this list a “D” to stand for Daily Notes. (If we could come up with an “E” we could call it the PARADE method.

&lt;p>Back in September 2021, Rhys Frampton outlined three main types of difficulty: comprehensive, executive, and strategic. Comprehensive difficulty relates to understanding the rules of the game while executive difficulty is about physicality (e.g. fast reflexes, coordination). Strategic difficulty relates to how to use your understanding of the rules and your reflexes to best master the game, your opponent, or yourself. #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Ars Technica’s Kyle Orland listed “five noncomprehensive subcategories” of gaming difficulty. Mechanical difficulty is about reflexes, punishing difficulty relates to how much of penalty you pay for mistakes (e.g. does the game make you start from the beginning when you die), arcane difficulty is about how much the game helps you learn to play, grindable difficulty is about the game giving you an option to power up via spending a lot of time performing tedious actions, and difficulty walls is about the presence of “impassable walls that fully impeded a player’s progress #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Even the hardest mountain can be ground down by a gentle stream if given enough time. Similarly, some games that seem tough at first can eventually be completed if you’re willing to put in the time to grind out improvements to your character’s power level.
In a game like Super Meat Boy, there’s no item you can find to make a difficult series of jumps any easier. In Elden Ring, on the other hand, the game can become significantly easier as you put in more time collecting the runes and items needed to power up your character level, weapons, and spells. #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Tip for Delivering Great Design Feedback During a Critique by Chris Lee Aug, 2021 UX Collective</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/A-Tip-for-Delivering-Great-Design-Feedback-During-a-Critique-by-Chris-Lee-Aug-2021-UX-Collective/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/A-Tip-for-Delivering-Great-Design-Feedback-During-a-Critique-by-Chris-Lee-Aug-2021-UX-Collective/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Edward Tufte has this visual rule that 1+1=3. With a single line on the screen, you have just that single object, but adding a second line does something interesting, it adds a third ‘object’ on the screen, the negative space between the two. All good visual designers deeply understand this effect.
In UX design we have a cognitive equivalent. If you have two buttons, there is a third ‘object’ created, the decision a user must make on which button to tap. This cognitive load is invisible and rarely discussed but it can be a real source of confusion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/A-Visual-Introduction-to-Machine-Learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/A-Visual-Introduction-to-Machine-Learning/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>I have chosen psycho-logic as a neutral and non-judgemental term. I have done this for a reason. When we do put a name to non-rational behaviour, it is usually a word like ‘emotion’, which makes it sound like logic’s evil twin. ‘You’re being emotional’ is used as code for ‘you’re being an idiot’. If you went into most boardrooms and announced that you had rejected a merger on ‘emotional grounds’, you would likely be shown the door. Yet we experience emotions for a reason – often a good reason for which we don’t have the words. (

&lt;p>Our very perception of the world is affected by context, which is why the rational attempt to contrive universal, context-free laws for human behaviour may be largely doomed. (

&lt;p>Unfortunately, many of your friends and colleagues, and most of all your finance director or your bank manager, won’t like any of these new non-sensical ideas, even the valuable ones. That’s not because they are expensive – most of them are very cheap indeed. No, he* will hate them because they don’t sit comfortably with his narrow, reductive worldview. But that’s the whole point – his narrow economic worldview has dominated decision-making for far too long. (

&lt;p>‘The trouble with market research is that people don’t think what they feel, they don’t say what they think, and they don’t do what they say.’* Trivers and Kurzban explained the evolutionary science behind that conundrum: we simply don’t have access to our genuine motivations, because it is not in our interest to know.

&lt;p>For a business to be truly customer-focused, it needs to ignore what people say. Instead it needs to concentrate on what people feel. (

&lt;p>The reason we do not ask basic questions is because, once our brain provides a logical answer, we stop looking for better ones; with a little alchemy, better answers can be found. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Once we are honest about the existence of unconscious motivations, we can broaden our possible solutions. It will free us to open up previously untried spaces for experimentation in resolving practical problems if we are able to discover what people really, really want,* rather than a) what they say they want or b) what we think they should want.

&lt;p>If a problem is solved using a discipline other than that practised by those who believe themselves the rightful guardians of the solution, you’ll face an uphill struggle no matter how much evidence you can amass. (

&lt;p>It seems likely that the biggest progress in the next 50 years may come not from improvements in technology but in psychology and design thinking. Put simply, it’s easy to achieve massive improvements in perception at a fraction of the cost of equivalent improvements in reality. (

&lt;p>This innovation came from the founder’s flash of insight (while watching a James Bond film, no less*) that, regardless of what we say, we are much bothered by the uncertainty of waiting than by the duration of a wait. The invention of the map was perhaps equivalent to multiplying the number of cabs on the road by a factor of ten – not because waiting times got any shorter, but because they felt ten times less irritating.

&lt;p>One of the great contributors to the profits of high-end restaurants is the fact that bottled water comes in two types, enabling waiters to ask ‘still or sparkling?’, making it rather difficult to say ‘just tap’. (

&lt;p>So said Alan Kay, one of the pioneers of computer graphics. It is, perhaps, the best defence of creativity in ten words or fewer. I suspect, too, that the opposite is also true: that an inability to change perspective is equivalent to a loss of intelligence.* (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard about the important of persistence. But I had misunderstood. Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what&amp;rsquo;s not working. We all have lots of ideas, creations and projects. When you present one to the world and it&amp;rsquo;s not a hit, don&amp;rsquo;t keep pushing it as is. instead get back to improving and inventing. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste years fighting uphill battles against locked doors. Improve or invent until you get that huge response (Page 11)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>How do you grade yourself?
For me, it&amp;rsquo;s how many useful things I create, whether songs, companies, articles, websites, or anything else. If I create something that&amp;rsquo;s not useful to others, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t count. But I&amp;rsquo;m also not interested in doing something useful unless it needs my creative input.
How do you grade yourself?
It&amp;rsquo;s important to know in advance, to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re staying focused on what&amp;rsquo;s honestly important to you, instead of doing what others thing you should (Page 37)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>As a business owner, when you screwed over by someone, you might be tempted to make a big grand policy that you think will prevent you ever getting screwed over again: One employee can&amp;rsquo;t focus and spends his time surfing the Web. Instead of just firing or reassigning that person to more challenging work, the company installs an expensive content-approving firewall so that nobody can go to unapproved sites ever again.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to resist that simplistic, angry, reactionary urge to punish everyone, and step back to look at the big picture. (Page 42)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>You should feel pain when you&amp;rsquo;re unclear
When writing an email to everyone, if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfectly clear, I&amp;rsquo;d get twenty thousand confused replies, whihc would take my staff all week to reply to, costing me at least $5,000 plus lost morale. Ever if I was very clear but took more than a few sentences to explain something, I&amp;rsquo;d get thousands of replies from people who never read past the first few sentences. Writing the email to customers-carefully eliminating every unnecessary word, and reshaping every sentence to make sure it could not be misunderstood-would take me all day. One unclear sentence? Immediate $5,000 penalty. Ouch. Unfortunately, people writing websites don&amp;rsquo;t get this kind of feedback. Instead, if they&amp;rsquo;re not clear, they just get silence. (Page 46)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>When you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of how to make your business bigger, it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to try to think all the big thoughts and come up with world-changing massive-action plans. But please know that it&amp;rsquo;s often the tiny details that really thrill people enough to make them tell all their friends about you. (Page 48)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>When you want to learn how to do something yourself, most people won&amp;rsquo;t understand. They&amp;rsquo;ll assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way.
But that&amp;rsquo;s forgetting about the joy of learning and doing. Yes, it may take longer. Yes, it may be inefficient. Yes, it may even cost you millions of dollars in lost opportunities because your business is growing slower because you&amp;rsquo;re insisting on doing something yourself. But the whole point of doing anything is because it makes you happy. That&amp;rsquo;s it! (Page 59)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Same Process.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Gather everybody around.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Answer the question and explain the philosophy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure everyone understands the thought process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask one person to write it in the manual.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let everybody know they can decide this without me next time.
After two months of this, there were no more questions. (Page 70)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>What if what you love the most is the solitude of the craft? Of talking to customers?
Never forget that you can make your role anything you want it to be. Anything you hate to do, someone else loves. So find that person and let her do it. (Page 72)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I learned an important word: abdicate. To abdicate means to surrender or relinquish power or responsibility; this word is usually used when a king abdicates the thong or crown.
Lesson learned too late: Delegate, but don&amp;rsquo;t abdicate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Anything You Want by Derek Sivers Summary, Notes and Lessons - Nat Eliason</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Anything-You-Want-by-Derek-Sivers-Summary-Notes-and-Lessons-Nat-Eliason/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Anything-You-Want-by-Derek-Sivers-Summary-Notes-and-Lessons-Nat-Eliason/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=480" rel="noopener">Location 480&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are. The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=488" rel="noopener">Location 488&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=553" rel="noopener">Location 553&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=682" rel="noopener">Location 682&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>How to Create a Good Habit The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=760" rel="noopener">Location 760&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>How to Break a Bad Habit Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible. Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=765" rel="noopener">Location 765&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.” Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=849" rel="noopener">Location 849&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.) But 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate. The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit. (

&lt;p>Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by his more common possessions. He wrote that there was “no more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of his stuff. Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced his rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to place above the mantel, and a better kitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase led to the next. Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. (

&lt;p>Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don’t know yet. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=1004" rel="noopener">Location 1004&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Strategies like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=1033" rel="noopener">Location 1033&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled with doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to grab one every now and then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=1058" rel="noopener">Location 1058&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious: If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter. If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand in the middle of the living room. If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack of stationery on your desk. If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and place them in common locations around the house. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=1109" rel="noopener">Location 1109&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=1116" rel="noopener">Location 1116&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=1121" rel="noopener">Location 1121&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watches television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different people can have different memories—and thus different habits—associated with the same place. The good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=1131" rel="noopener">Location 1131&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=1161" rel="noopener">Location 1161&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. (

&lt;p>If you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use. (

&lt;p>Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. In Byrne’s case, he bundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the thing he needed to do). (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. (

&lt;p>Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival. (

&lt;p>Meanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed increased safety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. As Charles Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.” (

&lt;p>Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together. (

&lt;p>Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. (

&lt;p>Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to. You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities. (

&lt;p>Exercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task that drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.” (

&lt;p>refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=1715" rel="noopener">Location 1715&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07D23CFGR&amp;amp;location=1721" rel="noopener">Location 1721&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing. (

&lt;p>Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How many does it take to form a new habit?” That is, how many repetitions are required to make a habit automatic? (

&lt;p>Like a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning their workspace to reduce wasted motion, successful companies design their products to automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible. They reduce the number of fields on each form. They pare down the number of clicks required to create an account. They deliver their products with easy-to-understand directions or ask their customers to make fewer choices. (

&lt;p>People often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. (

&lt;p>Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize. (

&lt;p>Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by specifically writing less than he felt like. He always stopped journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said. (

&lt;p>Becoming an Early Riser Phase 1: Be home by 10 p.m. every night. Phase 2: Have all devices (TV, phone, etc.) turned off by 10 p.m. every night. Phase 3: Be in bed by 10 p.m. every night (reading a book, talking with your partner). Phase 4: Lights off by 10 p.m. every night. Phase 5: Wake up at 6 a.m. every day. (

&lt;p>A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. (

&lt;p>The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. (

&lt;p>It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it. Buying a new jacket is fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t work if you’re trying to budget and save money. (

&lt;p>The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit. (

&lt;p>To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. (

&lt;p>If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible. Missing one workout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row. Maybe I’ll eat an entire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy meal. I can’t be perfect, but I can avoid a second lapse. (

&lt;p>This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. (

&lt;p>Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. (

&lt;p>Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. (

&lt;p>In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net. After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore. (

&lt;p>But this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. (

&lt;p>Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. (

&lt;p>I know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong. (

&lt;p>Each December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more.* Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three questions: What went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What did I learn? (

&lt;p>The build trap … describes the dysfunction that we see in many organizations and contributes to poor user experiences. Essentially, organizations get caught in the build trap when they prioritize outputs over outcomes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This phenomenon leads to the production of wasteful features that nobody wants and products that deliver little to no value.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Often, teams produce customer-facing user experiences with no real consideration of value exchange. These projects deliver no value and distract coworkers from supporting more valuable user experiences. Plus, the organization bears the costs of developing and maintaining products that they’ve created just for the sake of creating something—anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Product Management’s role by advocating for a strategy that focuses more on outcomes than output&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Perri recommends organizing teams based on value streams or an organization’s goals. Thus, a team could work across multiple technical features to effect the achievement of a strategic goal—for example, to increase conversions or reduce the number of support tickets users open. This approach minimizes wasted effort and increases the team’s focus on outcomes—on creating value&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Borrowed Creativity</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Borrowed-Creativity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Borrowed-Creativity/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Thiago, tell me about borrowed creativity. Borrowed creativity is the idea that creativity doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from nothing. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t just emerge from the void. Ah, in some mysterious kind of unexplainable process, it comes from somewhere all creativity is remixed. All of it is translated or repurposed from somewhere. Ah, and this is really something that I that I noticed growing up with artists. His parents. My dad is a painter, always has been a painter since he was three years old.

&lt;p>knowledge. You&amp;rsquo;re shifting it like a Rubik&amp;rsquo;s Cube, looking at it in a new way, and then that becomes the creativity. And it&amp;rsquo;s not trying to sit in a room just quietly and letting a new idea emerge. I have a theory. I think you&amp;rsquo;re absolutely right. And I have a theory why this is so hard for people. Think about what we were taught in school. No cheating. That was the sacrosanct, the most the most important rule in school. Well heard stories. Oh, did you hear about so and so in class number three who cheated? And now he has something on his permanent record he might not get in the college. Basically, his life was ruined because he cheated. But look at what? (

You weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to borrow. You weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to copy. You weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to emulate everything had to be original. But then, even during research like you&amp;rsquo;re writing a paper, an essay or something, you can borrow sources, but they have to be the most kind of the most basic sources, the most raw sources. So then, in our professional as we do that right, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to take, say, we don&amp;rsquo;t borrow from a a fully design website. But in the professional world, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what you want to borrow. You want to borrow the most refined, the most distilled, most advanced pieces of work because something like a like a very well designed website has so much thinking that&amp;rsquo;s gone into it. It&amp;rsquo;s such a dense kind of intellectual artifact. You want to take that now Don&amp;rsquo;t take literally like the name of the website that trademarked brand. But if you just go just a little bit before that and take kind of the essence of the thinking that&amp;rsquo;s been done, you can save, I mean countless hours of work. So tell me, what does it (

&lt;p>Leaderboards are especially efficient in doing this. Even this very rudimentary design offers a chance for players to instantly form several parallel goals:
Reach the top of the leaderboard,
If reaching the top is not immediately possible, at least try to climb up several places,
If even this is hard, at least try to overtake the player immediately above you&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>KEY IDEA: Divide the players into groups of 100 and make a separate leaderboard for each group&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Another approach is to periodically reset the league ladder and the scores of all players. This would result in all players having to reclimb the league ladder all over again, reliving the complete user experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Close Open Loops</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Close-Open-Loops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Close-Open-Loops/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>For instance: for operational to-dos, this means (Allen, 2015): You should be able to record a task anywhere You regularly drain tasks from this list You regularly delegate, refactor, or delete tasks which you can’t prioritize Taken together, these properties ensure that when you record a task, you can stop thinking about it. Ubiquitous capture isn’t enough, as most to-do systems demonstrate. If you don’t regularly review your task list and decide to delete or re-strategize lingering tasks, you won’t be able to trust that you’ll follow up on tasks you record.&lt;/p>

Effective quick capture is critical to the creative mind&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Compounding Time in Your Favor</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Compounding-Time-in-Your-Favor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Compounding-Time-in-Your-Favor/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>The smaller your niche at the start, the better. And make one video. It’ll give you ideas for a second. Maybe if you’re lucky to get a question in the comments, there’s a third. If you’re in it for the long haul, know your niche will change anyways - just pick something you can talk about for 3 minutes and film it. Figure out the rest as you go.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The more you practise, the better you’ll get. It just takes that first step to get started, and the first step is always the hardest. If you’re terrified, you’re in good company. Just know that everyone else who is starting, is just as scared and doing it anyway.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Day 3 👨‍⚕️ 5 Productivity Tips for Part-Time YouTubers - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Day-3-%EF%B8%8F-5-Productivity-Tips-for-Part-Time-YouTubers-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Day-3-%EF%B8%8F-5-Productivity-Tips-for-Part-Time-YouTubers-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Another thing I keep in mind is that no matter what I ‘teach’ or explain - I put myself in the position of a Guide rather than that of a Guru. I never paint myself as someone who’s figured it all out and is spreading his wisdom (the Guru). I’m just some guy with a camera who’s trying something out to see if it works and sharing his journey with others (Guide). If you’re the latter, it’s hard to go wrong.

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Consistency This is perhaps the single, most non-negotiable, biggest determinant of your success on YouTube. And it’s not glamorous. Pick a schedule and stick to it. Religiously. There’s so many reasons to do this. Firstly, the YouTube algorithm favours consistent, regular creators. And you always want the algorithm on your side. Secondly, you want someone to come to your channel and see a consistent backlog of content - if your last video is from 3 months ago and the one before that from 2018, it’s very very unlikely they’ll subscribe.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>As Brynjolfsson and McAfee point out, postwar Europe was an example of a bad time to be sitting on a pile of cash, as the combination of rapid inflation and aggressive taxation wiped out old fortunes with surprising speed (what we might call the “Downton Abbey Effect”). (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=310" rel="noopener">Location 310&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is necessary, but not sufficient. You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=362" rel="noopener">Location 362&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Ericsson opens his seminal paper on the topic with a powerful claim: “We deny that these differences [between expert performers and normal adults] (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=391" rel="noopener">Location 391&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>are immutable… Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=392" rel="noopener">Location 392&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=455" rel="noopener">Location 455&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We should not, therefore, expect the bottom-line impact of depth-destroying behaviors to be easily detected. As Tom Cochran discovered, such metrics fall into an opaque region resistant to easy measurement—a region I call the metric black hole. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=622" rel="noopener">Location 622&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=649" rel="noopener">Location 649&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>meetings for projects. These meetings tend to pile up and fracture schedules to the point where sustained focus during the day becomes impossible. Why do they persist? They’re easier. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=667" rel="noopener">Location 667&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=676" rel="noopener">Location 676&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=715" rel="noopener">Location 715&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>that in the absence of clear goals for your job, the visible busyness that surrounds shallow work becomes self-preserving, and that our culture has developed a belief that if a behavior relates to “the Internet,” then it’s good—regardless of its impact on our ability to produce valuable things. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=787" rel="noopener">Location 787&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>All of these trends are enabled by the difficulty of directly measuring the value of depth or the cost of ignoring it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=789" rel="noopener">Location 789&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>From this perspective, the small-scale details of how you spend your day aren’t that important, because what matters are the large-scale outcomes, such as whether or not you get a promotion or move to that nicer apartment. According to Gallagher, decades of research contradict this understanding. Our brains instead construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=856" rel="noopener">Location 856&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>and dark, but if you focus instead on an evening martini, you and your life become more pleasant—even though the circumstances in both scenarios are the same. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=859" rel="noopener">Location 859&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>“Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00X47ZVXM&amp;amp;location=860" rel="noopener">Location 860&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Stanford psychologist Laura Carstensen, to name one such example, used an fMRI scanner to study the brain behavior of subjects presented with both positive and negative imagery. She found that for young people, their amygdala (a center of emotion) fired with activity at both types of imagery. When she instead scanned the elderly, the amygdala fired only for the positive images. Carstensen hypothesizes that the elderly subjects had trained the prefrontal cortex to inhibit the amygdala in the presence of negative stimuli. These elderly subjects were not happier because their life circumstances were better than those of the young subjects; they were instead happier because they had rewired their brains to ignore the negative and savor the positive. By skillfully managing their attention, they improved their world without changing anything concrete about it. (

&lt;p>As I’ll discuss further in an upcoming post, our brains just aren’t good at carrying around that kind information, or more accurately, they aren’t good at retrieving it when we want it. It either will clog up our psychic RAM and take up valuable processing space, or it will be relegated to long term memory. Unfortunately the way our cranial long term storage works depends on cues that may or may not come to mind at the moment we need them. So writing down next actions and the contexts we know we’ll do them in, or digitally recording them, will make the best use of how our brains work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diagnosing Common Colour Management Issues</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Diagnosing-Common-Colour-Management-Issues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Diagnosing-Common-Colour-Management-Issues/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>If you’re using Figma or Adobe XD, things are a little more difficult. Figma and XD are not colour managed, so there is no way to assign or convert profiles for documents. I recommend setting up Figma so the canvas is displayed as sRGB, which helps a little, if you’re working on sRGB designs. It’s an app-wide setting just for the computer you’re making the change on, so other people viewing the document may see different colours&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>ColorSync Utility can be used to convert individual values from one colour space to another. ColorSync Utility is in the Utilities folder inside every Mac’s Applications folder.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dying With $0 - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Dying-With-0-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Dying-With-0-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Bill reckons that most of us stay in Ant Mode for way too long, optimising our lives for work+saving money even once we’re financially secure - either because it feels safer or because we feel it’s ‘the right thing to do’. But Bill argues that the minute we’re financially secure, we should start focusing on our quality of life, not our bank balance.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The point of life is to accumulate fulfilling experiences. In an ideal world, we’d simply trade our life energy for fulfilling experiences. That’d be sick. In the real world though, we have the intermediary of needing to make money to survive, and then have those experiences. So we have to trade our life energy - in the form of work - for money.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>But it’s a ridiculous notion that we should donate money to our kids on our deathbeds. That’d make the average age of inheritance 60, and when you’re 60, a big windfall isn’t that helpful. But when you’re 25-35, that big windfall is ridiculously helpful. So give money to your kids while you’re still alive.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>E1 Delivering Pizzas to Managing a Billion Dollar Business Ben Francis Gymshark CEO</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/E1-Delivering-Pizzas-to-Managing-a-Billion-Dollar-Business-Ben-Francis-Gymshark-CEO/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/E1-Delivering-Pizzas-to-Managing-a-Billion-Dollar-Business-Ben-Francis-Gymshark-CEO/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Speaker 0: sort of like I dropped out of uni like the week before. Um you know, I was, I was starting to really dig into. I felt like I was then taken, albeit not massive. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like massive financial risk, albeit you know, the stand cost everything that we had to fly the Youtubers over everything we had, we&amp;rsquo;d we&amp;rsquo;ve risked everything. We had several times. Um but it was, you know, I just felt really excited about it and the thing that we did well which I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of is we didn&amp;rsquo;t rest at that point, we did one great event. So then the next year we did to the next year we did five and we just went and went and went and we kept spending everything we had on punts that we thought might come off. But stuff that got told us was the right thing to do.
Speaker 1: So between (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Speaker 1: of questions and we kind of on that white board over there, just like drafted out this structure, which just made so much sense and brought so much clarity. Yeah, I was like, I can&amp;rsquo;t believe how much clarity I&amp;rsquo;ve now got in my mind from just drawing this diagram on the board,
Speaker 0: so it makes such a difference, but you&amp;rsquo;ll find like when you work with genuinely brilliant people like that, they revolutionized like teams, businesses, brands, everything like so many people talk about all the different nuts and bolts of businesses and brands, but ultimately it&amp;rsquo;s literally just people, it comes down to people and it&amp;rsquo;s so important that you understand how to work with people and you know, work with great people. I am similarly, I was chatting to someone the other week and I was talking about that he was, he worked with one of the most successful business people have sort of like my parents generation and I just said, (

I am similarly, I was chatting to someone the other week and I was talking about that he was, he worked with one of the most successful business people have sort of like my parents generation and I just said, all right, what do they do it in a sentence? Like cut all the bullshit. So I think one sentence, what do they do really well? And they said they attracted great people and then left them alone and I just thought that was so cool and I think, you know, in its most simplistic form, that&amp;rsquo;s what any great entrepreneurial business person does and they do it in different (
&lt;a href="https://www.airr.io/quote/615defb4cceec3ea04be01ab" rel="noopener">Time 0:49:25&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Speaker 0: you need to be, he genuinely thought I was the right person and incompetent enough to do the role, but I needed to really prove it. Um and the alternative was to hire someone else. Now, fortunately I got to the level of being able to do the role. So two years of making sure I could speak publicly, talk to camera, understand a profit and loss properly understand, you know, long term strategic decisions and working with teams and all that sort of stuff, which again, going to the different chiefs roles that I&amp;rsquo;ve done, it gave me incredible grounding across the business, which really helps. And then more recently the official transition started May 1st and it completes august 1st and we&amp;rsquo;re, we&amp;rsquo;re what july now, middle of july. So I&amp;rsquo;m about two or three weeks away from like officially completing that handover,
Speaker 1: so two years worth of kind of like training to be the (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Speaker 0: I need to do X, y and z and then I would, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been good at just like Battering something for like 12 hours straight. I would have to do is just a little thing every single day and then having that goal in my head, like the best example I can give was I want to be Ceo, I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at public speaking, so I need to be, I need to get that Republic speakers, like one of my things was literally public speaking and then I was sort of navigate through life and as I&amp;rsquo;m an event, whatever on the tube, chatting to people as you go, what do you do for a living? I spoke to someone and they&amp;rsquo;re like, oh, I&amp;rsquo;m a public speaking coach and normally I&amp;rsquo;d be like, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the goal, it would be nice to have a lovely day, see you soon. But because I had this goal and it was in my list, I&amp;rsquo;m like, oh my God, I&amp;rsquo;d love to be great public speaking, Can I take your number? Can we chat some more? Can I learn from you? So this is why I think it&amp;rsquo;s so important to have that goal because then I think it helps yourself (
&lt;a href="https://www.airr.io/quote/615e4074cceec3ea04060024" rel="noopener">Time 1:08:38&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Speaker 1: in that when you manifest, when you, when you have a goal, like I want to become the Ceo you start seeing the opportunities that you want to seen.
Speaker 0: Otherwise you see what you look for. Don&amp;rsquo;t you like the public
Speaker 1: speaking thing or you know, when I decided I wanted to buy a Tesla, suddenly I started seeing Tesla&amp;rsquo;s everyone everywhere because you just have that thing and so your brain turns onto the various options here. So I think that&amp;rsquo;s really
Speaker 0: cool. Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m a massive, massive advocate for that. I think just whatever it is just set a name and the thing is that it&amp;rsquo;s been really powerful for me is I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone, I want to be a ceo, so I&amp;rsquo;m gonna do these massive things like set the bar so low and it&amp;rsquo;s only now looking back I realized everything I&amp;rsquo;ve ever wanted to do, I&amp;rsquo;ve set the bar low so jim sharp was started because I wanted to be involved in fitness. The website was built because I wanted the website that would transact, I didn&amp;rsquo;t (

Here&amp;rsquo;s some feedback about that one and they would work on the video idea the concept for the next week. And the following monday, we&amp;rsquo;d have like the full video basically ready. And then I would kind of go through it to be like, okay, if I were actually filming this based on these points, you know, I&amp;rsquo;d add a story about my life over there, harry potter reference over there, we&amp;rsquo;ll put a story from medicine over there and then the video is ready to film so that when it comes to thursday we can bang bang film for videos
Speaker 0: in a day. So when you say bang bang bang, are you talking, would they would, what would you, what would it look like to you? So someone else has come up with an idea you have in a script, you have in key messages that you just having a title, what does that? Yeah,
Speaker 1: so title thumbnail and talking points. So bullet points, I don&amp;rsquo;t like reading from a script. It (

&lt;p>Speaker 0: a load of different angles in a low different ways. And it&amp;rsquo;s exactly the way that we and I try and solve problems that jim shakin in life. So I found that book massively inspiring. And then moving around Youtube, I love your channel. You introduced me to notion notion life like genuinely life changing. We I mean we&amp;rsquo;ve run almost everything on notion now. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait from a creative point in the entire the entire business by the way, not just as a person. I run. I think you you coined it like a life. Os I have my life O. S. I have a professional life. Different jim shark stuff. Everything from the notion. So that was a life changing to thank you for that. You&amp;rsquo;re very welcome. Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s it. I just all around the internet Jordan Peterson, I love jane Peterson, a massive, massive fan of him. I think he&amp;rsquo;s brilliant. He&amp;rsquo;s really helped me as well. (

&lt;p>Speaker 0: jane Peterson, a massive, massive fan of him. I think he&amp;rsquo;s brilliant. He&amp;rsquo;s really helped me as well.
Speaker 1: I&amp;rsquo;d love to check out your notion. Set up behind
Speaker 0: scenes. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that as we&amp;rsquo;re driving out. Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s
Speaker 1: really cool. That
Speaker 0: would be, it would be pretty
Speaker 1: sick. Um Cool. And any sort of, let&amp;rsquo;s say someone&amp;rsquo;s watching this and they&amp;rsquo;re thinking they&amp;rsquo;re they want to get started being an entrepreneur. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;re sort of Late teens, early 20s haven&amp;rsquo;t really started anything yet, but really inspired by you and your journey. Any kind of
Speaker 0: advice you give? Yeah, I mean it&amp;rsquo;s fairly standard, right? You have to do what you love because otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll end up, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up giving up. I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer now that there&amp;rsquo;s no niche too small, especially with the internet being so vast, I always think, and it sounds stupid saying it now, if I&amp;rsquo;d have said (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Speaker 0: just think there&amp;rsquo;s no need to small. So I think whatever it is double down on it and just genuinely give it a go. Like, Jim Sharp was the seventh business website product that I&amp;rsquo;ve made and the other six failed miserably now. Unfortunately, that&amp;rsquo;s not a sexy story. So no one talks about the failed apps, the failed websites, they only talk about the one that did well and it&amp;rsquo;s a consistent theme on everyone else that successful that I&amp;rsquo;ve met. They failed miserably so many times and they&amp;rsquo;ve been endlessly optimistic about it and they&amp;rsquo;ve just gone again and again and again.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that, like, I, I see this a lot with people starting YouTube channels where there&amp;rsquo;s this sense of, I have to get it right first time. Yeah. And if you look at the stats, like the average YouTube channel takes 152 videos to get to 1000 subscribers. I get messages from people being like, you know, like (

&lt;p>TECHNOLOGY HAS PRODUCED a variety of productivity tools, from task boards to to-do lists, from relational databases to outlines. Yet, rather than give users a sense of accomplishment, they can often instill a sense of being overwhelmed, reminding us what we have left to do.
*Experience Designers should ensure they leave users with a sense of accomplishment *&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Learning from their experiences, I developed a simple technique to supplement the digital tools that failed to serve them. The &amp;ldquo;got-done list&amp;rdquo; is a running log of accomplishments. Kept alongside a traditional &amp;ldquo;to-do list,&amp;rdquo; I asked my clients to record the additional things they did, big or small #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In his book Chatter: The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It, Ethan Kross, professor and director of the Emotion and Self Control Lab at the University of Michigan, wrote “Your mood is defined not by what you did but by what you thought about.”
&lt;a href="https://brandonkboswell.com/seedlings/Your-mood-is-not-defined-by-what-you-did-but-by-what-you-think-about" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="https://brandonkboswell.com/seedlings/Your-mood-is-not-defined-by-what-you-did-but-by-what-you-think-about">Your mood is not defined by what you did, but by what you think about&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>First, a got-done list helps us capture the unanticipated small wins that can spur progress. “It’s at least as important to keep track of things you got done as it is to keep track of things you have to do. Very often, much of the work we get done in a day wasn’t on the to-do list we had at the start of the day, because it involved solving an unexpected problem or dealing with other work that suddenly became more urgent.”&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Step 1: Each morning, think of just one important thing you must do that day.
Step 2: Look at your calendar. Note what you have scheduled and figure out when you can complete that most important task
&lt;a href="https://brandonkboswell.com/Daily-Planning" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="https://brandonkboswell.com/Daily-Planning">Daily Planning&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Step 3: Identify and note other things you need to achieve, but keep your to-do short and reasonable.
Step 4: As you go about your day, tick off your assignments as you complete them. If you find yourself doing things you did not schedule, write them down and then check them off.
Step 5: Every evening, take a moment to add in anything you missed. Relish your small wins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Friday Refill Give Tomorrow-You Advice From Today</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Friday-Refill-Give-Tomorrow-You-Advice-From-Today/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Friday-Refill-Give-Tomorrow-You-Advice-From-Today/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>The highlighted time interval is the duration until the user is tested again on the question. Questions start out with the time interval “in-text”, meaning the user is being tested as they read the essay. That rises to five days, if the user remembers the answer to the question. The interval then continues to rise upon each successful review, from five days to two weeks, then a month, and so on. After just five successful reviews the interval is at four months. If the user doesn’t remember at any point, the time interval drops down one level, e.g., from two weeks to five days.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>This takes advantage of a fundamental fact about human memory: as we are repeatedly tested on a question, our memory of the answer gets stronger, and we are likely to retain it for longer&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>! What are novel uses or Spaced Repetition?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>With the time taken to review a typical question being just a few seconds, that means a user can achieve long-term recall with no more than a few minutes’ work. By contrast, with conventional flashcards it takes hours of review to achieve the same durability. Exponential scheduling is far more efficient.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Does a Bestseller Happen A Case Study in Hitting #1 on the New York Times – The Blog of Author Tim Ferriss</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/How-Does-a-Bestseller-Happen-A-Case-Study-in-Hitting-#1-on-the-New-York-Times-The-Blog-of-Author-Tim-Ferriss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/How-Does-a-Bestseller-Happen-A-Case-Study-in-Hitting-#1-on-the-New-York-Times-The-Blog-of-Author-Tim-Ferriss/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Identify and name a legitimate societal shift or new phenomenon. To best spread a message or product, sell around it by discussing larger issues surrounding its creation: the person (me in this case), the changing social landscape, and emerging trends. No one cares about your new software, but the reasons it needs to exist might make for a great TV segment on 20/20. Naturally, the software would be mentioned. Mission accomplished without the hard sell.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I Journal and Take Notes</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/How-I-Journal-and-Take-Notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/How-I-Journal-and-Take-Notes/</guid><description>&lt;p>From: &lt;em>Tim Ferriss&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First thing in the morning, I’m The Pilot. I grab my morning coffee, take a step back, and figure out what I want to get done that day. Then I take a break and switch into being The Plane. At this point, and for the rest of the day, my job is just to execute orders that The Pilot’s already given. Crucially, I don’t need to worry about planning, or think too hard about what I could be doing with my time. #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Once I’ve set my Daily Highlight, I time-block it in my calendar, and protect that time from any meetings or distractions that pop up during the day. #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The final (and most optional) step is to make a might-do list. Unlike a list of stuff I have to do, it’s a brain dump of tasks I might do if I feel like it. I try to capture 100% of the possible tasks for that day. This clears my brain of internal clutter and helps The Pilot confirm that the Daily Highlight is the highest-priority thing for the day. #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Avoid a Backwards Habit - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/How-to-Avoid-a-Backwards-Habit-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/How-to-Avoid-a-Backwards-Habit-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>The challenge I face with making strategy-based decisions is that it means &lt;em>saying no&lt;/em> to 1,000 other things. I don’t like to make decisions; I want options! Amateurs keep their options open. They say yes to everything. They have no boundaries.

&lt;p>Turning Pro by Steven Pressfield. Says the difference between a pro and an amateur is that pros concentrate on the real work (like buckling down to write the next book), while amateurs spend most of their time doing fake work like marketing or researching new gear. Fake work can be important and useful, but it should take up less than 10% of your time if you really want to go pro. #review&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>any improvement in the way we organise the everyday writing, how we take notes of what we encounter and what we do with them, will make all the difference for the moment we do face the blank page/screen – or rather not, as those who take smart notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=136" rel="noopener">Location 136&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic and wonder why there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=143" rel="noopener">Location 143&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Just having it all in your head is not enough, as getting it down on paper is the hard bit. That is why good, productive writing is based on good note-taking. Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=155" rel="noopener">Location 155&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=166" rel="noopener">Location 166&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>It is not so important who you are, but what you do. Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, to success. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=169" rel="noopener">Location 169&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Self-discipline or self-control is not that easy to achieve with willpower alone. Willpower is, as far as we know today,[2] a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=172" rel="noopener">Location 172&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=179" rel="noopener">Location 179&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Planners are also unlikely to continue with their studies after they finish their examinations. They are rather glad it is over. Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=212" rel="noopener">Location 212&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In fact, poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor students lack insight into their own limitations – as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=228" rel="noopener">Location 228&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>It is not about redoing what you have done before, but about changing the way of working from now on. There is really no need to reorganise anything you already have. Just deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them anyway. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=257" rel="noopener">Location 257&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Even the best tool will not improve your productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines the tool is embedded in, (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=264" rel="noopener">Location 264&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=276" rel="noopener">Location 276&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: Some of the best learnings are portable from tool to tool.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>There is no point in having great tools if they don’t fit together. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=298" rel="noopener">Location 298&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, it&amp;rsquo;s better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=374" rel="noopener">Location 374&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=381" rel="noopener">Location 381&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=416" rel="noopener">Location 416&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=491" rel="noopener">Location 491&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: So that you can refer back to them in the future&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. (

&lt;p>Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box – it only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. (

&lt;p>Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters. (

&lt;p>It is public because in the discussion, it does not matter anymore what the author meant, only what is there in writing. (

&lt;p>Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing. (

&lt;p>The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. (

&lt;p>Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in the reference system or, written as if for print, in the slip-box. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=806" rel="noopener">Location 806&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Only if the notes of these three categories are kept separated it will be possible to build a critical mass of ideas within the slip-box. (

&lt;p>He always carries a notebook with him and often makes a few quick notes during a conversation. The advantage is obvious: No idea ever gets lost. The disadvantages are serious, though: As he treats every note as if it belongs to the “permanent” category, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=816" rel="noopener">Location 816&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else. When you are in a conversation, listening to a lecture, hear something noteworthy or an idea pops into your mind while you are running errands, a quick note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of doing. That might even apply to reading, if you want to focus on a text without interrupting your reading flow. Then you might want to just underline sentences or write short comments in the margins. It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=838" rel="noopener">Location 838&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: TickTick shoukd be my repo for fleeting notes that i then need to process into permanent notes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=844" rel="noopener">Location 844&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=848" rel="noopener">Location 848&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>That is why the threshold to write an idea down has to be as low as possible, but it is equally crucial to elaborate on them within a day or two. A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal. In the first case, you forgot what it was supposed to remind you of. In the second case, you forgot the context that gave it its meaning. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=850" rel="noopener">Location 850&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Luhmann never underlined sentences in the text he read or wrote comments in the margins. All he did was take brief notes about the ideas that caught his attention in a text on a separate piece of paper: “I make a note with the bibliographic details. On the backside I would write ‘on page x is this, on page y is that,’ and then it goes into the bibliographic slip-box where I collect everything I read.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=856" rel="noopener">Location 856&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: The fact that i read in the bed makes this challenging.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=866" rel="noopener">Location 866&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>But if we feel constantly stuck in our work, we will become demotivated and much more likely to procrastinate, leaving us with fewer positive or even bad experiences like missed deadlines. (

&lt;p>Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, or in the more general terms of psychologist Carol Dweck, to grow. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Following a circular approach, on the other hand, allows you to implement many feedback loops, which give you the chance to improve your work while you are working on it. It is not just about increasing the number of opportunities to learn, but also to be able to correct the mistakes we inevitably make. As the feedback loops are usually smaller than one big chunk of feedback at the end, they are also much less scary and easier to embrace. (

&lt;p>Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=1031" rel="noopener">Location 1031&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information. That makes it easier not only to learn and remember, but also to retrieve the information later in the moment and context it is needed. (

&lt;p>Multitasking is not what we think it is. It is not focusing attention on more than one thing at a time. Nobody can do that. When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. And every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment we manage to get focused again. (

&lt;p>When we proofread a manuscript, we take on the role of a critic who takes a step back to see the text with the eyes of a dispassionate reader. We scan the text for typos, try to smooth out patches and check structure. We deliberately put distance between ourselves and the text to see what is really on the paper, not just in our heads. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: This is an important point as to why its useful to have others proofread, because they can see only what is on the paper. If we as people can practice this skill we can be better at producing on our own timelines.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>“On one hand, those with wandering, defocused, childlike minds seem to be the most creative; on the other, it seems to be analysis and application that’s important. The answer to this conundrum is that creative people need both … The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.” (Dean, 2013, 152) (

&lt;p>Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus, researchers on expertise, have a simple explanation: Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow (their) rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations. Unlike the expert paramedics, they did not look at the unique circumstances and check if the paramedics in the videos did the best thing possible in each individual situation. Instead, they focused on the question of whether the people in the videos acted according to the rules they taught. (

&lt;p>psychologists used to tend to agree on a very specific number when it came to short-term memory: We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>While we want to remember some things as long as possible, we don’t want to clog our brains with irrelevant information. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance. But thanks to Zeigarnik’s follow-up research, we also know that we don’t actually have to finish tasks to convince our brains to stop thinking about them. All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>make sure we always write down the outcome of our thinking, including possible connections to further inquiries. As the outcome of each task is written down and possible connections become visible, it is easy to pick up the work any time where we left it without having to keep it in mind all the time. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Letting thoughts linger without focusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in a different, often surprisingly productive way. While we have a walk or a shower or clean the house, the brain cannot help but play around with the last unsolved problem it came across. And that is why we so often find the answer to a question in rather casual situations. (

&lt;p>It is well known that decision-making is one of the most tiring and wearying tasks, which is why people like Barack Obama or Bill Gates only wear two suit colours: dark blue or dark grey.

&lt;p>Translating means to give the truest possible account of the original work, using different words – it does not mean the freedom to make something fit. As well, the mere copying of quotes almost always changes their meaning by stripping them out of context, even though the words aren’t changed. This is a common beginner mistake, which can only lead to a patchwork of ideas, but never a coherent thought. (

&lt;p>It is mainly a matter of having an extensive latticework of mental models or theories in our heads that enable us to identify and describe the main ideas quickly (

&lt;p>Different independent studies indicate that writing by hand facilitates understanding. In a small but fascinating study, two psychologists tried to find out if it made a difference if students in a lecture took notes by hand or by typing them into their laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). They were not able to find any difference in terms of the number of facts the students were able to remember. But in terms of understanding the content of the lecture, the students who took their notes by hand came out much, much better. After a week, this difference in understanding was still clearly measurable. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Handwriting is slower and can’t be corrected as quickly as electronic notes. Because students can’t write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. But to be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in the first place. So if you are writing by hand, you are forced to think about what you hear (or read) (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=1441" rel="noopener">Location 1441&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>we are naturally drawn to everything that makes us feel good, which is everything that confirms what we already believe we know. (

&lt;p>The ability to distinguish relevant from less relevant information is another skill that can only be learned by doing. It is the practice of looking for the gist and distinguishing it from mere supporting details. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text. Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it. On top of that, we also tend to like it more (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;amp;location=1583" rel="noopener">Location 1583&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The slip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memory resource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brain to focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, and frees it up to be creative. (

&lt;p>When we take permanent notes, it is much more a form of thinking within the medium of writing and in dialogue with the already existing notes within the slip-box than a protocol of preconceived ideas. Any thought of a certain complexity requires writing. (

&lt;p>Richard Feynman once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted to interview him. When he spotted Feynman’s notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such “wonderful records of Feynman’s thinking.” “No, no!” Feynman protested. “They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.” (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>elaboration is nothing more than connecting information to other information in a meaningful way. The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well. (

&lt;p>Learned right, which means understanding, which means connecting in a meaningful way to previous knowledge, information almost cannot be forgotten anymore and will be reliably retrieved if triggered by the right cues. (

&lt;p>If we forget about an idea and have it again, our brains get as excited as if we are having it the first time. Therefore, working with the slip-box is disillusioning, but at the same time it increases the chance that we actually move forward in our thinking towards uncharted territory, instead of just feeling like we are moving forward.

&lt;p>A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes. This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience. (

&lt;p>Language in itself is extremely standardised and limited in many ways. We are restricted to the use of only 26 letters, but what that enables us to do! We can write novels, theories, love letters or court orders – just by rearranging these 26 letters. This is certainly not possible despite the restriction to 26 letters, but because of it. Nobody will open a book and wish it contains more types of letters or be disappointed because it is, again, just another variation of the same alphabet. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: But this is also why language evolves because we have a limited set of letters and words. Would this repurposing of words still happen with more letters available to us?&lt;/li>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Just look into your slip-box and see where clusters have been built up. These clusters are what caught your interest again and again, so you already know that you have found material to work with. Now you can spread out these notes on your desktop or use the outliner of the Zettelkasten, outline your argument and construct a preliminary order of sections, chapters or paragraphs. This will make questions, which are not answered, obvious, and it will show the gaps in the argument that need to be filled and make visible which parts still need some work. (

&lt;p>Being intimately familiar with something enables us to be playful with it, to modify it, to spot new and different ideas without running the risk of merely repeating old ideas believing they are new. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: Early into a specific field we feel we are doing innovative things that are not novel or new. As we spend more time with a field we feel like we are being less innovative, but are actually being more innovative. We are poor judges of how innovative our ideas are. This is another form of the curse of knowledge.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Nothing motivates us more than seeing a project we can identify with moving forward, and nothing is more demotivating than being stuck with a project that doesn’t seem to be worth doing. (

&lt;p>With this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 125–55) It is like martial arts: If you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it, but redirect it towards another productive goal.

&lt;p>If there is one piece of advice that is worth giving, it is to keep in mind that the first draft is only the first draft. Slavoj Žižek said in an interview[41] that he wouldn’t be able to write a single sentence if he didn’t start by convincing himself he was only writing down some ideas for himself, and that maybe he could turn it into something publishable later. By the time he stopped writing, he was always surprised to find that the only thing left to do was revise the draft he already had. (

&lt;p>The goal here is to get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects. If we manage to establish a routine in this first step, it becomes much easier to develop the urge to turn these findings into permanent notes and connect them with other notes in the slip-box. (

&lt;p>What I was expecting—and quite literally craving at this point in our relationship—was validation. I wanted to feel like she saw, understood, and shared in my excitement. I wasn’t telling her the story because I liked talking; I was sharing it with her in the hope that she would see my excitement and get excited with me. I was hoping we would connect over the shared experience. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: This is what we&amp;rsquo;re looking for as humans. To share experiences with others. This is why watching a movie with someone else is so much more rewarding than watching it by yourself.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Thus, the core idea of this book is that, in order to become a “great listener,” you actually need to become a great validator. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071K4MWMK&amp;amp;location=279" rel="noopener">Location 279&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>While they were exposed to the same stressors as the other group, those who had their feelings validated found it significantly easier to regulate their emotions and keep their cool. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071K4MWMK&amp;amp;location=386" rel="noopener">Location 386&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: We did a good job at employing this at the Valley go live.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>More often than not, people who vent or complain already know how to handle their current situation—they’re just looking for someone to see and appreciate their struggle. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071K4MWMK&amp;amp;location=388" rel="noopener">Location 388&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>There are, of course, countless ways to validate. As long as you show the other person that you recognize and accept their emotions, you’re validating. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071K4MWMK&amp;amp;location=393" rel="noopener">Location 393&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The truth is there’s nothing inherently good or bad about any emotion. Emotions just are. They’re simply reactions to a situation. And, whether we like it or not, we’re going to feel a whole slew of them, each and every day, for the rest of our lives. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071K4MWMK&amp;amp;location=420" rel="noopener">Location 420&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>When someone is in that state, a simple “don’t worry” doesn’t help. If you instead show them that you see and appreciate what they’re feeling, they’ll either find a solution of their own, or become much more willing to listen to yours. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071K4MWMK&amp;amp;location=447" rel="noopener">Location 447&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The result is simple, respectful, nonjudgmental support that helps Amy talk through and let go of her frustration rather than trying to ignore or suppress it. Their conversation becomes much more pleasant and connecting, and leads to a significantly more positive outcome. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071K4MWMK&amp;amp;location=552" rel="noopener">Location 552&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Validation has two main elements. It 1) acknowledges a specific emotion, and 2) offers justification for feeling that emotion. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071K4MWMK&amp;amp;location=662" rel="noopener">Location 662&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Validation is nonjudgmental. It allows the other person to feel whatever they’re feeling without labeling it as “good” or “bad.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071K4MWMK&amp;amp;location=665" rel="noopener">Location 665&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Offering validation—before or instead of offering advice or assurance—is often the best way to help. Doing so helps others let go of difficult emotions much more quickly, often allowing them to find a solution to the problem on their own. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071K4MWMK&amp;amp;location=670" rel="noopener">Location 670&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If someone is distraught, angry, or concerned, validating them is your best chance at getting them to be receptive to feedback. The great thing is, you can validate someone even if you disagree with them. Learning to do so will give you a valuable tool for navigating confrontations, negotiations, disagreements, and the like. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B071K4MWMK&amp;amp;location=777" rel="noopener">Location 777&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Effective validation requires empathy and emotional understanding, and therefore extends beyond simple reflective listening. We need to do more than just show others we hear the words they are speaking; we need to show them we’re connecting with the emotions they’re feeling. (

&lt;p>in any way. But to me, each one of those things is an intellectual asset, right? It&amp;rsquo;s an intellectual. It&amp;rsquo;s like an artifact, and you have no idea how those could be useful in the future. One of the things that people don&amp;rsquo;t do is they don&amp;rsquo;t take a lot of their even simplest forms of creation seriously enough. I&amp;rsquo;m amazed at how many of my ideas start is a conversation starters. A text message start is an email, and what I&amp;rsquo;ll do is I&amp;rsquo;ll recycle the idea and each stage whenever I reuse it, I begin to see the idea in a new light. The idea begins to become clearer, more compressed in my mind so the text message will become an article. The article will become a speech. The speech will become another article, and that article will then become a course. And so what I&amp;rsquo;m doing is I&amp;rsquo;m taking the (

&lt;p>me I don&amp;rsquo;t need to do that. Not only do you not need to do that, you really can&amp;rsquo;t. That&amp;rsquo;s no way to build. It&amp;rsquo;s no way to build an academic career. It&amp;rsquo;s no way to build a professional career. It&amp;rsquo;s no way to build a business. It&amp;rsquo;s just too risky. It&amp;rsquo;s too risky. You don&amp;rsquo;t know what is going to succeed you. You have a sort of blindness. It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes called

You are the least qualified person to know which ideas that you have are the best ones because you&amp;rsquo;re immersed in them. You have no perspective. You have no objectivity. So the on leeway to find that out is to constantly be out putting as much as you can as diverse a range of thoughts and ideas, and then see which ones really resonate with people. And almost always, I can tell you this, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be the one you least expect. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna be the one you take for granted, the one that you think, Oh, doesn&amp;rsquo;t everyone know this isn&amp;rsquo;t this, like, obvious, and it&amp;rsquo;s obvious to you. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s so powerful. It&amp;rsquo;s something that that for most people has never occurred to them. Yeah, what I try to look for is ideas that are obvious to me, but amazing toe others. That&amp;rsquo;s the sweet spot. What I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about here (

&lt;p>The truly prolific artists I know always have that question answered, because they have figured out a daily practice—a repeatable way of working that insulates them from success, failure, and the chaos of the outside world. They have all identified what they want to spend their time on, and they work at it every day, no matter what. Whether their latest thing is universally rejected, ignored, or acclaimed, they know they’ll still get up tomorrow and do their work. (

&lt;p>To establish your own routine, you have to spend some time observing your days and your moods. Where are the free spaces in your schedule? What could you cut out of your day to make time? Are you an early riser or a night owl? (I’ve met very few people who love working in the afternoon. “I detest this mongrel time, neither day nor night,” wrote Charles Dickens.) Are there silly rituals or superstitions that get you in a creative mood? (I’m writing these words with a pencil, painted to look like a cigarette, dangling from my lips.) (

&lt;p>A little imprisonment—if it’s of your own making—can set you free. Rather than restricting your freedom, a routine gives you freedom by protecting you from the ups and downs of life and helping you take advantage of your limited time, energy, and talent. A routine establishes good habits that can lead to your best work. (

&lt;p>Best of all, I think, is that when your days pretty much have the same shape, the days that don’t have that shape become even more interesting. There’s nothing like a good prison break, and playing hooky isn’t as fun if you never go to school. What your daily routine consists of is not that important. What’s important is that the routine exists. Cobble together your own routine, stick to it most days, break from it once in a while for fun, and modify it as necessary. (

&lt;p>When there’s something I want to do in the future but don’t have time for right now, I add it to what productivity expert David Allen calls a “Someday/Maybe” list. Writer Steven Johnson does this in a single document he calls a “spark file”—every time he has an idea, he adds it to the file, and then he revisits the list every couple of months. (

&lt;p>“Finish every day and be done with it. You have done what you could; some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin it well and serenely, and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense.” (

&lt;p>When the sun goes down and you look back on the day, go easy on yourself. A little self-forgiveness goes a long way. Before you go to bed, make a list of anything you did accomplish, and write down a list of what you want to get done tomorrow. Then forget about it. Hit the pillow with a clear mind. Let your subconscious work on stuff while you’re sleeping. (

&lt;p>You must have a room, or a certain hour or so a day, where you don’t know what was in the newspapers that morning, you don’t know who your friends are, you don’t know what you owe anybody, you don’t know what anybody owes to you. This is a place where you can simply experience and bring forth what you are and what you might be. This is the place of creative incubation. At first you may find that nothing happens there. But if you have a sacred place and use it, something eventually will happen. (

&lt;p>There’s almost nothing in the news that any of us need to read in the first hour of the day.

&lt;p>I’m so insanely lucky right now. I live the dream, in a sense, because I get paid to do what I would probably do anyway for free. But things can get very, very tricky when you turn the thing you love into the thing that keeps you and your family clothed and fed. Everyone who’s turned their passion into their breadwinning knows this is dangerous territory. One of the easiest ways to hate something you love is to turn it into your job: taking the thing that keeps you alive spiritually and turning it into the thing that keeps you alive literally. (

&lt;p>I marvel at how every ancient poem is basically a withering commentary on our contemporary politicians.

&lt;p>French chefs practice something called mise en place, which means “set in place.” It’s about planning and preparation: making sure all the ingredients and tools you need are ready before you set to work. “Mise en place is the religion of all good line cooks,” Anthony Bourdain wrote in Kitchen Confidential. “Your station, and its condition, its state of readiness, is an extension of your nervous system.” (

&lt;p>WHEN IN DOUBT, TIDY UP. Note that it says “when in doubt,” not “always.” Tidying up is for when I’m stalled out or stuck. Tidying up a studio is—sorry, Ms. Kondo—not life-changing or magical. It’s just a form of productive procrastination. (Avoiding work by doing other work.) The best thing about tidying is that it busies my hands and loosens up my mind so that I either a) get unstuck or solve a new problem in my head, or b) come across something in the mess that leads to new work.

&lt;p>Not all naps are created equal. There are lots of ways to take a nap. Salvador Dalí liked to nap while holding a spoon. As he dozed off, he’d drop the spoon and wake up, but still be in the dreamlike state he needed for his surreal paintings. (

&lt;p>When we’re glued to our screens, the world looks unreal. Terrible. Not worth saving or even spending time with. Everyone on earth seems like a troll or a maniac or worse. But you get outside and you start walking and you come to your senses. Yeah, there are a few maniacs and some ugliness, but there are also people smiling, birds chirping, clouds flying overhead . . . all that stuff. There’s possibility. Walking is a way to find possibility in your life when there doesn’t seem to be any left. (

&lt;p>from one domain to another. You know this This kind of comes back to the second brain idea because so think about what&amp;rsquo;s the problem with &lt;em>multitasking&lt;/em>. What&amp;rsquo;s the problem with switching back and forth between things? It&amp;rsquo;s that you lose your progress, right? If you&amp;rsquo;re working on a memo to your company and you only get 50% finished and you move to something else when you come back, you&amp;rsquo;ll have lost whatever thinking was done. And this goes back to why it&amp;rsquo;s so important and so powerful to save everything outside your head. When you&amp;rsquo;re doing that, work externally and you step away for whatever reason, your current progress, by definition, is saved. It&amp;rsquo;s there in an external medium that doesn&amp;rsquo;t just disappear like your your thoughts do, and so ironically, and this is this is very weird. How this (

&lt;p>Adam Smith and David Ricardo argued that all value comes from labor, and the value of something is in the amount of labor it took to produce it.
But Henry George understood that this is backward. The value of something lies in how much labor we’re willing to exchange for it.
Too often, we’re tempted to price things based on what they cost us to make. It’s more useful to price things based on what they’re worth to those that might want to buy them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Made to Stick</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Made-to-Stick/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Made-to-Stick/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>How do we find the essential core of our ideas? A successful defense lawyer says, “If you argue ten points, even if each is a good point, when they get back to the jury room they won’t remember any.” To strip an idea down to its core, we must be masters of exclusion. We must relentlessly prioritize. Saying something short is not the mission—sound bites are not the ideal. Proverbs are the ideal. We must create ideas that are both simple and profound. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>how do we maintain their interest when we need time to get the ideas across? We need to violate people’s expectations. We need to be counterintuitive. A bag of popcorn is as unhealthy as a whole day’s worth of fatty foods! We can use surprise—an emotion whose function is to increase alertness and cause focus—to grab people’s attention. But surprise doesn’t last. For our idea to endure, we must generate interest and curiosity. (

&lt;p>When we’re trying to build a case for something, most of us instinctively grasp for hard numbers. But in many cases this is exactly the wrong approach. In the sole U.S. presidential debate in 1980 between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, Reagan could have cited innumerable statistics demonstrating the sluggishness of the economy. Instead, he asked a simple question that allowed voters to test for themselves: “Before you vote, ask yourself if you are better off today than you were four years ago.” (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>How do we get people to act on our ideas? We tell stories. Firefighters naturally swap stories after every fire, and by doing so they multiply their experience; after years of hearing stories, they have a richer, more complete mental catalog of critical situations they might confront during a fire and the appropriate responses to those situations. Research shows that mentally rehearsing a situation helps us perform better when we encounter that situation in the physical environment. (

&lt;p>To summarize, here’s our checklist for creating a successful idea: a Simple Unexpected Concrete Credentialed Emotional Story. A clever observer will note that this sentence can be compacted into the acronym SUCCESs. (

&lt;p>This is the Curse of Knowledge. Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has “cursed” us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can’t readily re-create our listeners’ state of mind. (

&lt;p>“Over time we’ve come to understand more and more about what makes people successful in complex operations.” He believes that plans are useful, in the sense that they are proof that planning has taken place. The planning process forces people to think through the right issues. But as for the plans themselves, Kolditz says, “They just don’t work on the battlefield.” So, in the 1980s the Army adapted its planning process, inventing a concept called Commander’s Intent (CI). CI is a crisp, plain-talk statement that appears at the top of every order, specifying the plan’s goal, the desired end-state of an operation. (

&lt;p>Commander’s Intent manages to align the behavior of soldiers at all levels without requiring play-by-play instructions from their leaders. When people know the desired destination, they’re free to improvise, as needed, in arriving there. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The Combat Maneuver Training Center, the unit in charge of military simulations, recommends that officers arrive at the Commander’s Intent by asking themselves two questions: If we do nothing else during tomorrow’s mission, we must _________________. The single, most important thing that we must do tomorrow is ________________. (

&lt;p>If we’re to succeed, the first step is this: Be simple. Not simple in terms of “dumbing down” or “sound bites.” You don’t have to speak in monosyllables to be simple. What we mean by “simple” is finding the core of the idea. “Finding the core” means stripping an idea down to its most critical essence. To get to the core, we’ve got to weed out superfluous and tangential elements. But that’s the easy part. The hard part is weeding out ideas that may be really important but just aren’t the most important idea. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>“A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” A designer of simple ideas should aspire to the same goal: knowing how much can be wrung out of an idea before it begins to lose its essence. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Forced prioritization is really painful. Smart people recognize the value of all the material. They see nuance, multiple perspectives—and because they fully appreciate the complexities of a situation, they’re often tempted to linger there. This tendency to gravitate toward complexity is perpetually at war with the need to prioritize. (

&lt;p>Adams can’t possibly be personally involved in the vast majority of these hundreds of small decisions. But his employees don’t suffer from decision paralysis, because Adams’s Commander’s Intent is clear: “Names, names, and names.” Adams can’t be everywhere. But by finding the core and communicating it clearly, he has made himself everywhere. That’s the power of a sticky idea. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We’ve seen that compact ideas are stickier, but that compact ideas alone aren’t valuable—only ideas with profound compactness are valuable. So, to make a profound idea compact you’ve got to pack a lot of meaning into a little bit of messaging. And how do you do that? You use flags. You tap the existing memory terrain of your audience. You use what’s already there. (

&lt;p>The most basic way to get someone’s attention is this: Break a pattern. Humans adapt incredibly quickly to consistent patterns. Consistent sensory stimulation makes us tune out: Think of the hum of an air conditioner, or traffic noise, or the smell of a candle, or the sight of a bookshelf. We may become consciously aware of these things only when something changes: The air conditioner shuts off. Your spouse rearranges the books. (

&lt;p>Surprise makes us want to find an answer—to resolve the question of why we were surprised—and big surprises call for big answers. If we want to motivate people to pay attention, we should seize the power of big surprises. (

&lt;p>Another example we discussed in Chapter 1 was Southwest Airlines’ proverb “THE low-cost airline.” Again, most Southwest staffers and customers know that Southwest is a discount airline. In that context, the proverb seems intuitive. It was only when Kelleher put teeth in the proverb—refusing to offer chicken salad to customers even if they really wanted it—that its meaning sank in. Before Kelleher, an average staffer’s guessing machine might have predicted, “We want to please our customers in a low-cost way.” After Kelleher, the guessing machine was refined to “We will be THE low-cost airline, even if it means intentionally disregarding some of our customers’ preferences.” (

&lt;li>Note: What seemingly reasonable thing are you willing to give up in your unabashed pursuit of your primary objective?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>So, a good process for making your ideas stickier is: (1) Identify the central message you need to communicate—find the core; (2) Figure out what is counterintuitive about the message—i.e., What are the unexpected implications of your core message? Why isn’t it already happening naturally? (3) Communicate your message in a way that breaks your audience’s guessing machines along the critical, counterintuitive dimension. Then, once their guessing machines have failed, help them refine their machines. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Common sense is the enemy of sticky messages. When messages sound like common sense, they float gently in one ear and out the other. And why shouldn’t they? If I already intuitively “get” what you’re trying to tell me, why should I obsess about remembering it? The danger, of course, is that what sounds like common sense often isn’t, as with the Hoover Adams and Southwest examples. It’s your job, as a communicator, to expose the parts of your message that are uncommon sense. (

&lt;p>Curiosity, he says, happens when we feel a gap in our knowledge. Loewenstein argues that gaps cause pain. When we want to know something but don’t, it’s like having an itch that we need to scratch. To take away the pain, we need to fill the knowledge gap. We sit patiently through bad movies, even though they may be painful to watch, because it’s too painful not to know how they end. (

&lt;p>To make our communications more effective, we need to shift our thinking from “What information do I need to convey?” to “What questions do I want my audience to ask?” (

&lt;p>Curiosity comes from gaps in our knowledge. (

&lt;p>Unexpected ideas, by opening a knowledge gap, tease and flirt. They mark a big red X on something that needs to be discovered but don’t necessarily tell you how to get there. And, as we’ll see, a red X of spectacular size can end up driving the actions of thousands of people for many years. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Both of these unexpected ideas set up big knowledge gaps—but not so big that they seemed insurmountable. Kennedy didn’t propose a “man on Mercury,” and Ibuka didn’t propose an “implantable radio.” Each goal was audacious and provocative, but not paralyzing. Any engineer who heard the “man on the moon” speech must have begun brainstorming immediately: “Well, first we’d need to solve this problem, then we’d need to develop this technology, then. . (

&lt;p>Concrete language helps people, especially novices, understand new concepts. Abstraction is the luxury of the expert. If you’ve got to teach an idea to a room full of people, and you aren’t certain what they know, concreteness is the only safe language. (

&lt;p>Yale researcher Eric Havelock studies tales that have been passed down by word of mouth, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey. He notes that these tales are characterized by lots of concrete actions, with few abstractions. Why? The ancient Greeks certainly had no problem with abstraction—this was the society that produced Plato and Aristotle, after all. Havelock believes that the stories evolved away from abstraction over time. When they were passed along from generation to generation, the more memorable concrete details survived and the abstractions evaporated. (

&lt;p>Memory, then, is not like a single filing cabinet. It is more like Velcro. If you look at the two sides of Velcro material, you’ll see that one is covered with thousands of tiny hooks and the other is covered with thousands of tiny loops. When you press the two sides together, a huge number of hooks get snagged inside the loops, and that’s what causes Velcro to seal. Your brain hosts a truly staggering number of loops. The more hooks an idea has, the better it will cling to memory. Your childhood home has a gazillion hooks in your brain. A new credit card number has one, if it’s lucky. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>But if concreteness is so powerful, why do we slip so easily into abstraction? The reason is simple: because the difference between an expert and a novice is the ability to think abstractly. New jurors are struck by lawyers’ personalities and factual details and courtroom rituals. Meanwhile, judges weigh the current case against the abstract lessons of past cases and legal precedent. Biology students try to remember whether reptiles lay eggs or not. Biology teachers think in terms of the grand system of animal taxonomy. (

&lt;p>When Boeing prepared to launch the design of the 727 passenger plane in the 1960s, its managers set a goal that was deliberately concrete: The 727 must seat 131 passengers, fly nonstop from Miami to New York City, and land on Runway 4-22 at La Guardia. (The 4-22 runway was chosen for its length—less than a mile, which was much too short for any of the existing passenger jets.) With a goal this concrete, Boeing effectively coordinated the actions of thousands of experts in various aspects of engineering or manufacturing. Imagine how much harder it would have been to build a 727 whose goal was to be “the best passenger plane in the world.” (

&lt;p>Researchers get excited about pushing the boundaries of a technology, making products that are complex and sophisticated, while customers generally seek out products that are easy and reliable. The desires of researchers and customers don’t always dovetail. (

&lt;p>Concreteness helped this team of experts coordinate. A diverse group of engineers, accustomed to contemplating difficult technology problems, suddenly came face-to-face with the Ferrari family. By grappling with one family’s concrete needs—their tickets and reservations and photos—they did something remarkable: They took abstract ideas from their research labs and turned them into a family picture on a roller-coaster ride.

&lt;p>Concreteness creates a shared “turf” on which people can collaborate. Everybody in the room feels comfortable that they’re tackling the same challenge. Even experts—even the Kleiner Perkins venture capitalists, the rock stars of the technology world—benefit from concrete talk that puts them on common ground. (

&lt;p>This message is from James Grant, who was the director of UNICEF for many years. Grant always traveled with a packet filled with one teaspoon of salt and eight teaspoons of sugar—the ingredients for Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) when mixed with a liter of water. When he met with the prime ministers of developing countries, he would take out his packet of salt and sugar and say, “Do you know that this costs less than a cup of tea and it can save hundreds of thousands of children’s lives in your country?” (

&lt;p>The moral is to find some way to invite people to the table, to help them bring their knowledge to bear. Here, a prop works better than a scientific description. (

&lt;p>“I knew their demographics by heart. But it was a very different experience to walk into a customer’s home and experience a little bit of her life. I’ll never forget one woman, who had a toddler on her hip while she was mixing up dinner on the stove. We know that ‘convenience’ is an important attribute of our product, but it’s a different thing to see the need for convenience firsthand.” (

&lt;p>Only 37 percent said they have a clear understanding of what their organization is trying to achieve and why. • Only one in five was enthusiastic about their team’s and their organization’s goals. • Only one in five said they had a clear “line of sight” between their tasks and their team’s and organization’s goals. • Only 15 percent felt that their organization fully enables them to execute key goals. • Only 20 percent fully trusted the organization they work for. Pretty sobering stuff. It’s also pretty abstract. You probably walk away from these stats thinking something like “There’s a lot of dissatisfaction and confusion in most companies.” Then Covey superimposes a very human metaphor over the statistics. He says, “If, say, a soccer team had these same scores, only 4 of the 11 players on the field would know which goal is theirs. Only 2 of the 11 would care. Only 2 of the 11 would know what position they play and know exactly what they are supposed to do. And all but 2 players would, in some way, be competing against their own team members rather than the opponent.” The soccer analogy generates a human context for the statistics. It creates a sense of drama and a sense of movement. We can’t help but imagine the actions of the two players trying to score a goal, being opposed at every stage by the rest of their team. Why does the analogy work? It relies on our schema of soccer teams and the fact that this schema is somehow cleaner, more well-defined, than our schemas of organizations. It’s more vivid to think of a lack of cooperation on a soccer team—where teamwork is paramount—than in a corporation. And this is exactly Covey’s point: Corporations should operate like teams, but they don’t. Humanizing the statistics gives the argument greater wallop. (

&lt;p>When it comes to statistics, our best advice is to use them as input, not output. Use them to make up your mind on an issue. Don’t make up your mind and then go looking for the numbers to support yourself—that’s asking for temptation and trouble. But if we use statistics to help us make up our minds, we’ll be in a great position to share the pivotal numbers with others, as did Geoff Ainscow and the Beyond War supporters. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>LINE:When we use statistics, the less we rely on the actual numbers the better. The numbers inform us about the underlying relationship, but there are better ways to illustrate the underlying relationship than the numbers themselves. Juxtaposing the deer and the shark is similar to Ainscow’s use of BBs in a bucket. (

&lt;p>In this study they primed some people to think in an analytical way by asking questions such as, “If an object travels at five feet per minute, then by your calculations how many feet will it travel in 360 seconds?” Other people were primed to think in terms of feelings: “Please write down one word to describe how you feel when you hear the word ‘baby.’” Then both groups were given the Rokia letter. And, confirming the researchers’ theory, the analytically primed people gave less. When people were primed to feel before they read about Rokia, they gave $2.34, about the same as before. But when they were primed to calculate before they read about Rokia, they gave $1.26. These results are shocking. The mere act of calculation reduced people’s charity. Once we put on our analytical hat, we react to emotional appeals differently. We hinder our ability to feel. (

&lt;p>Caples says companies often emphasize features when they should be emphasizing benefits. “The most frequent reason for unsuccessful advertising is advertisers who are so full of their own accomplishments (the world’s best seed!) that they forget to tell us why we should buy (the world’s best lawn!).” An old advertising maxim says you’ve got to spell out the benefit of the benefit. In other words, people don’t buy quarter-inch drill bits. They buy quarter-inch holes so they can hang their children’s pictures. (

&lt;p>In 1954, a psychologist named Abraham Maslow surveyed the research in psychology about what motivates people. He boiled down volumes of existing research to a list of needs and desires that people try to fulfill: • Transcendence: help others realize their potential • Self-actualization: realize our own potential, self-fulfillment, peak experiences • Aesthetic: symmetry, order, beauty, balance • Learning: know, understand, mentally connect • Esteem: achieve, be competent, gain approval, independence, status • Belonging: love, family, friends, affection • Security: protection, safety, stability • Physical: hunger, thirst, bodily comfort (

&lt;p>How can we make people care about our ideas? We get them to take off their Analytical Hats. We create empathy for specific individuals. We show how our ideas are associated with things that people already care about. We appeal to their self-interest, but we also appeal to their identities—not only to the people they are right now but also to the people they would like to be (

&lt;p>The event-simulation group—the people who simulated how the events unfolded—did better on almost every dimension. Simulating past events is much more helpful than simulating future outcomes. In fact, the gap between the groups opened up immediately after the first session in the lab. By the first night, the event-simulation people were already experiencing a positive mood boost compared with the other two groups. When the groups returned a week later, the event simulators’ advantage had grown wider. They were more likely to have taken specific action to solve their problems. They were more likely to have sought advice and support from others. They were more likely to report that they had learned something and grown. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Why does mental simulation work? It works because we can’t imagine events or sequences without evoking the same modules of the brain that are evoked in real physical activity. Brain scans show that when people imagine a flashing light, they activate the visual area of the brain; when they imagine someone tapping on their skin, they activate tactile areas of the brain. The activity of mental simulation is not limited to the insides of our heads. People who imagine words that start with b or p can’t resist subtle lip movements, and people who imagine looking at the Eiffel Tower can’t resist moving their eyes upward. Mental simulation can even alter visceral physical responses: When people drink water but imagine that it’s lemon juice, they salivate more. Even more surprisingly, when people drink lemon juice but imagine that it’s water, they salivate less. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Mental simulation helped people weld better and throw darts better. Trombonists improved their playing, and competitive figure skaters improved their skating. Not surprisingly, mental practice is more effective when a task involves more mental activity (e.g., trombone playing) as opposed to physical activity (e.g., balancing), but the magnitude of gains from mental practice is large on average: Overall, mental practice alone produced about two thirds of the benefits of actual physical practice. The takeaway is simple: Mental simulation is not as good as actually doing something, but it’s the next best thing. And, to circle back to the world of sticky ideas, what we’re suggesting is that the right kind of story is, effectively, a simulation. Stories are like flight simulators for the brain. Hearing the nurse’s heart-monitor story isn’t like being there, but it’s the next best thing. (

&lt;p>The goal here is to learn how to spot the stories that have potential. When the Jared article hits our desk, we want to spot the crucial elements immediately. Guy faces huge obstacles and overcomes them—it’s a Challenge plot. Challenge plots inspire people to take on challenges and work harder. If that feeling is consistent with the goal you want to achieve, run with the story; (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Denning defines a springboard story as a story that lets people see how an existing problem might change. Springboard stories tell people about possibilities. One major advantage of springboard stories is that they combat skepticism and create buy-in. Denning says that the idea of telling stories initially violated his intuition. He had always believed in the value of being direct, and he worried that stories were too ambiguous, too peripheral, too anecdotal. He thought, “Why not spell out the message directly? Why go to the trouble and difficulty of trying to elicit the listener’s thinking indirectly, when it would be so much simpler if I come straight out in an abstract directive? Why not hit the listeners between the eyes?” The problem is that when you hit listeners between the eyes they respond by fighting back. The way you deliver a message to them is a cue to how they should react. If you make an argument, you’re implicitly asking them to evaluate your argument—judge it, debate it, criticize it—and then argue back, at least in their minds. (

&lt;p>Stories can almost single-handedly defeat the Curse of Knowledge. In fact, they naturally embody most of the SUCCESs framework. Stories are almost always Concrete. Most of them have Emotional and Unexpected elements. The hardest part of using stories effectively is making sure that they’re Simple—that they reflect your core message. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The question we have to ask ourselves in any situation is this: Is the audience’s version of my message still core? In Chapter 1 (“Simple”), we discussed the importance of focusing on core messages—honing in on the most important truths that we need to communicate. If the world takes our ideas and changes them—or accepts some and discards others—all we need to decide is whether the mutated versions are still core. If they are—as with “It’s the economy, stupid”—then we should humbly embrace the audience’s judgment. Ultimately, the test of our success as idea creators isn’t whether people mimic our exact words, it’s whether we achieve our goals. (

And the difference I think is &lt;em>leverage&lt;/em>. We talked a lot about leverage in our in our work either day by day, you&amp;rsquo;re building some sort of leverage and you can think of leverage as power, some source of power, some source of um of influence that is increasing with time, you can think of, you know, an investing account that you&amp;rsquo;re putting money into every month as a form of leverage over time that&amp;rsquo;s going to get more and more powerful. A blog That you regularly published two as a form of leverage every post. You add ads not one post of value but adds kind of &lt;em>exponential value&lt;/em>. The posts and the (

&lt;p>Speaker 1: of like a it&amp;rsquo;s like a catalyst. Um, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re doing, building up this these &lt;em>knowledge assets&lt;/em> is making it each day&amp;rsquo;s work a little bit easier for tomorrow, self for next week&amp;rsquo;s self, for next month&amp;rsquo;s self. You
Speaker 0: know, what&amp;rsquo;s crazy, what second brain did for me transcends all of this. What it did was it made me treat my future self as if that person was real and it didn&amp;rsquo;t just have an impact with my ideas. It had an impact on the way I eat the quality of my sleep, my fitness routines. Because for the first time in my life, I was actually creating something for future David. And I was thinking, what will 30 year old David, what will 40 year old, 50, 60, 70 year old David want? And normally it&amp;rsquo;s called the End of history illusion. You think that the person that you are now is the person that you&amp;rsquo;re always going to be. But when you have the second brain, you&amp;rsquo;re always thinking about what your future self is gonna want and it becomes this radical shift in your own identity, treating who you&amp;rsquo;re going to be in the future as somebody worth considering, like a wife, like a sister,
Speaker 1: like a mother.
Speaker 0: And when that happens, you&amp;rsquo;re able to act with more direction, more diligence and live a healthier (

Speaker 1: I think so. And here&amp;rsquo;s the trick though, that makes doing this with ideas so powerful usually. I mean, what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about here is &lt;em>delayed gratification&lt;/em>. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s a trade off. I can favor myself now or I can favor myself in the future with finances. You think I can spend the money now, I can spend the money later, that you can&amp;rsquo;t really spend it both times, but with ideas you can. So what I notice is when I write something down, I get a benefit in that instant, I get the benefit of seeing my idea in a concrete form. I get the benefit of having it, not on my mind and not having to keep track of it, I get the benefit of sharing it with someone else. And so we&amp;rsquo;re talking (

&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The first thing we learned was that something magic happens when you start the day with one high-priority goal. Each sprint day, we drew attention to one big focal point: On Monday, the team creates a map of the problem; on Tuesday, each person sketches one solution; on Wednesday, they decide which solutions are best; on Thursday, they build a prototype; and on Friday, they test it. Each day’s goal is ambitious, but it’s just one thing. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=447" rel="noopener">Location 447&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We also learned about the importance of energy for focused work and clear thinking. When we first started running design sprints, teams worked long hours, fueled by sugary treats. Late in the week, energy would plummet. So we made adjustments, and saw how things like a healthy lunch, a quick walk, frequent breaks, and a slightly shorter workday helped maintain peak energy, resulting in better and more effective work. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=455" rel="noopener">Location 455&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The first step is choosing a single highlight to prioritize in your day. Next, you’ll employ specific tactics to stay laser-focused on that highlight—we’ll offer a menu of tricks to beat distraction in an always-connected world. Throughout the day, you’ll build energy so you can stay in control of your time and attention. Finally, you’ll reflect on the day with a few simple notes. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=500" rel="noopener">Location 500&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The first step in Make Time is deciding what you want to make time for. Every day, you’ll choose a single activity to prioritize and protect in your calendar. It might be an important goal at work, like finishing a presentation. You might choose something at home, like cooking dinner or planting your garden. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=506" rel="noopener">Location 506&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Asking yourself “What’s going to be the highlight of my day?” ensures that you spend time on the things that matter to you and don’t lose the entire day reacting to other people’s priorities. When you choose a Highlight, you put yourself in a positive, proactive frame of mind. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=513" rel="noopener">Location 513&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Finally, before going to bed, you’ll take a few notes. It’s super simple: You’ll decide which tactics you want to continue and which ones you want to refine or drop.2 And you’ll think back on your energy level, whether you made time for your Highlight, and what brought you joy in the day. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=536" rel="noopener">Location 536&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I loved thinking about big, lofty goals and I was good at getting things done hour by hour, but neither was truly satisfying. I was happiest when I had something I could hold on to in the present—a chunk of time that was bigger than a to-do but smaller than a five-year goal. An activity I could plan for, look forward to, and appreciate when it was done. In other words, I needed to make sure every day had a highlight. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=645" rel="noopener">Location 645&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Your Highlight gives each day a focal point. Research shows that the way you experience your days is not determined primarily by what happens to you. In fact, you create your own reality by choosing what you pay attention to.1 This might seem obvious, but we think it’s a big deal: You can design your time by choosing where you direct your attention. And your daily Highlight is the target of that attention. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=664" rel="noopener">Location 664&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The second Highlight strategy is to think about satisfaction: At the end of the day, which Highlight will bring me the most satisfaction? (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=691" rel="noopener">Location 691&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The third strategy focuses on joy: When I reflect on today, what will bring me the most joy? (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=704" rel="noopener">Location 704&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>To other people, some of your joyful Highlights may look like wastes of time: sitting at home reading a book, meeting a friend to play Frisbee in the park, even doing a crossword puzzle. Not to us. You only waste time if you’re not intentional about how you spend it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=707" rel="noopener">Location 707&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>A good rule of thumb is to choose a Highlight that takes sixty to ninety minutes. If you spend less than sixty minutes, you might not have time to get in the zone, but after ninety minutes of focused attention, most people need a break. Sixty to ninety minutes is a sweet spot. It’s enough time to do something meaningful, and it’s a reasonable amount of time to create in your schedule. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=717" rel="noopener">Location 717&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If yesterday’s Highlight brought you joy or satisfaction, hey, there’s nothing wrong with more of that! Repeat to keep the good times rolling. You don’t have to reinvent yourself each day. Once you’ve identified something that’s important to you, focusing on it day after day will help it take root in your life, grow, and flourish. Sounds cheesy, but it’s true. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=776" rel="noopener">Location 776&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Use daily “do not schedule” blocks to make room for your Highlight. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=992" rel="noopener">Location 992&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Could you squeeze in a new project but worry about giving it the proper attention? “Unfortunately, I don’t have the time to do a great job on this.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1045" rel="noopener">Location 1045&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Our friend Kristen Brillantes uses what she calls the Sour Patch Kid method when she says no. Just like the candy, Kristen’s answers are sour at first but sweet at the end. For example: “Unfortunately, my team won’t be able to participate. But you might ask Team X; they’d be perfect for this kind of event.” The key, says Kristen, is to make sure the sweet ending is authentic, not an empty add-on. If she can, she’ll offer a connection to another person with capacity or interest for whom the invitation might be a cool opportunity. If not, she offers encouragement or gratitude. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1054" rel="noopener">Location 1054&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Coffee is also super important to me. Sure, the caffeine is nice, but the preparation routine is essential to my morning. It takes me fifteen minutes to make coffee using a simple pour-over technique: boil water, grind beans, position filter, add grounds, pour water. This process is more labor-intensive than using a machine, but that’s the idea. My slow coffee ritual keeps me occupied during the low-willpower period when I would otherwise check email or look at Twitter, both of which are likely to send me into a reactive vortex of unproductivity. Instead, I stand in the kitchen (or galley), wake up slowly, think about my day, and enjoy a fresh cup of coffee while I settle in to work on my Highlight. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1123" rel="noopener">Location 1123&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Finally, adjust your environment to wind down and signal “bedtime” to your body. I begin by lowering the lights. I turn off peripheral lights in the kitchen and foyer, then switch to floor lamps in the living room and bedroom. My favorite routine—and dorkiest by far—is a do-it-yourself turn-down service. Around 7 p.m. each night, I close the curtains in the bedroom, remove the decorative pillows from the bed, and pull back the covers. (Check out #84, “Fake the Sunset,” for more.) (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1143" rel="noopener">Location 1143&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If I’m planning to stay up and work on a project, I’ll start by refreshing my brain with a real break (#80). After my younger son goes to bed (around 8:30 p.m.), I might sit down with my wife and older son and watch part of a movie. Or I might read a few pages in a novel. Or I might clean the kitchen and put away toys in the living room. These activities take my mind out of “busy mode” and recharge my mental battery—a major difference from the frenzy of checking email, reading clickbait news articles, or watching an intense TV show designed to suck me into a black hole of binge watching.7 (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1176" rel="noopener">Location 1176&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Around nine-thirty, I’ll switch into Highlight mode, usually for writing but sometimes to prepare a presentation or workshop. Even with a quick battery recharge, my focus is usually not at 100 percent, so I put a vacation timer on the Internet (#28), allowing me to concentrate on my writing with minimal willpower. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1183" rel="noopener">Location 1183&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I learned the hard way that I have to spin down my brain after late-night work or I’ll seriously mess up my sleep. Dimming the lights (#84) helps, but most important is getting to bed before I turn into a pumpkin. For me, that magic hour is 11:30 p.m., and if I’m not in bed by then, I’ll tank my energy the next day. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1188" rel="noopener">Location 1188&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We evolved to be distractible because it kept us safe from danger (check the flash in your peripheral vision—it might be a stalking tiger or a falling tree!). We evolved to love mysteries and stories because they helped us learn and communicate. We evolved to love gossip and seek social status because that allowed us to form tight-knit protective tribes. And we evolved to love unpredictable rewards, whether from a blackberry bush or a smartphone notification, because the possibility of those rewards kept us hunting and gathering even when we returned home empty-handed. Our caveman brains are the fourth secret ingredient. Of course we love email, video games, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat—it’s literally in our DNA. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1345" rel="noopener">Location 1345&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>These tactics are all based on the same philosophy: The best way to defeat distraction is to make it harder to react. By adding a few steps that get in the way of checking Facebook, catching up on the news, or turning on the TV, you can short-circuit the cycle that makes these products so sticky. After just a few days, you’ll have a new set of defaults: You’ll go from distracted to focused, from reactive to intentional, and from overwhelmed to in control. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1373" rel="noopener">Location 1373&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you change your priorities, people will notice. Your actions show others what’s important to you. When your friends, your coworkers, and your kids and family see you being intentional with your time, you’ll give them permission to question their own “always on” default and step away from their own Infinity Pools. You aren’t just making time for yourself and your own Highlight; you’re also setting a good example for the people around you. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1392" rel="noopener">Location 1392&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>My phone used to call to me from my pocket the way the Ring called to Bilbo Baggins. The second I felt even the slightest twinge of boredom, my phone would appear in the palm of my hand as if by magic. Now, without Infinity Pool apps, I feel less twitchy. Those moments when I used to instinctively reach for my phone, I’m forced to pause—and it turns out those moments are not so boring after all. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1418" rel="noopener">Location 1418&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Delete social apps. First, delete Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and so on (including whatever else has been invented since we wrote this). Don’t worry. If you change your mind later, it is very easy to install these apps again. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1445" rel="noopener">Location 1445&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Delete other Infinity Pools. Anything with an infinite supply of interesting content should be deleted. This includes games, news apps, and streaming video like YouTube. If you might refresh it obsessively and/or lose hours without meaning to, get rid of it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1448" rel="noopener">Location 1448&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Log Out Typing in your username and password is a hassle, so websites and apps make sure you don’t have to do it very often. They encourage you to stay logged in, leaving the door to distraction wide open. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1479" rel="noopener">Location 1479&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Notifications are not your friends. They’re nonstop attention thieves. Whether or not you try a distraction-free phone, you should at the very least turn off almost all notifications. Here’s how. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1499" rel="noopener">Location 1499&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Leaving your devices behind is a helpful tactic when you want to make time for an “offline” Highlight like reading to your kids or working on a project with your hands. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1549" rel="noopener">Location 1549&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>When you wake up in the morning, whether you slept for five hours or ten, you’ve had a nice long break from the Busy Bandwagon and the Infinity Pools. This is a golden moment. The day is fresh, your brain is rested, and you have no reason to feel distracted yet. No news items to stress about, no work emails to stew over. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1575" rel="noopener">Location 1575&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The morning is prime time for my Highlight, which usually involves the computer. So each night I do myself a favor by closing all my browser tabs (#26) and logging out of Twitter and Facebook (#18). Then, after I wake up and make coffee, I’m ready to start my Highlight without any distractions from the morning check-in. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1585" rel="noopener">Location 1585&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We’ve got some breaking news of our own: You don’t need to follow the daily news. True breaking news will find you, and the rest isn’t urgent or just doesn’t matter. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1624" rel="noopener">Location 1624&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Reacting to what’s in front of you is always easier than doing what you intend. And when they’re staring you right in the face, tasks such as checking email, responding to a chat, and reading the news feel urgent and important—but they rarely are. If you want to get into Laser mode faster, we recommend putting your toys away. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1661" rel="noopener">Location 1661&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Note: This is especially true for me&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Because you’re literally buckled into a chair, I’ve always found planes a terrific spot to do a lot of writing and reading and drawing and thinking. —AUSTIN KLEON (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1671" rel="noopener">Location 1671&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Tens of thousands of years ago, a 150-foot-wide chunk of rock smashed into the earth’s surface, blasting a crater about a mile in diameter. A young Jake stood on the blistered rock and imagined the awesome force of impact. The crater is thirty times the size of the meteor! It’s crazy to think about such a small object making such a big hole. Or maybe it’s not so crazy. After all, the same thing happens in our daily lives. Small distractions create much larger holes in our day. We call these holes “time craters,” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1732" rel="noopener">Location 1732&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Sports have a powerful grip on us. They satisfy an innate tribal urge. We grow up watching local teams with our parents, families, and friends. We discuss sports with colleagues and strangers. Each game and season has an unpredictable story line, but (unlike real life) they all finish with clear-cut win-or-lose outcomes that we find deeply gratifying. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1797" rel="noopener">Location 1797&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Eventually, our email took on a life of its own. We were supposed to be clearing it out of the way so that we could do our work, but instead, on most days, email was the work.11 It was a vicious cycle: The faster we replied, the more replies we got back and the more we strengthened the expectation of immediate responses. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1835" rel="noopener">Location 1835&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you check email less often, research suggests that you’ll be less stressed and just as on top of things. A 2014 study by the University of British Columbia found that when people checked their email just three times a day (instead of as often as they wanted), they reported remarkably lower stress. As researchers Elizabeth Dunn and Kostadin Kushlev put it, “Cutting back on email might reduce stress as much as picturing yourself swimming in the warm waters of a tropical island several times a day.” Maybe more surprising, checking less often made the participants better at email. During the week when they checked three times a day, people answered roughly the same number of messages, but they did so 20 percent faster. Checking email less often measurably made time! (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1841" rel="noopener">Location 1841&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Instead of checking your email first thing in the morning and then getting sucked in and reacting to other people’s priorities, deal with email at the end of the day. That way, you can use your prime hours for your Highlight and other important work. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1850" rel="noopener">Location 1850&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>When you know you’ve got time set aside later, it’s easier to avoid wasting time on email now. And if you schedule your email time before a firm commitment such as a meeting or leaving the office, you’ll get an additional boost: When email time is done, it’s done. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1856" rel="noopener">Location 1856&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>you’re better off treating email like old-fashioned paper letters—you know, the kind with envelopes and stamps. Snail mail gets delivered only once a day. Most letters sit on your desk for a while before you do anything about them. And for 99 percent of communications, that works just fine. Try slowing down and seeing your email as what it really is: just a fancy, dressed-up, high-tech version of regular old mail. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1867" rel="noopener">Location 1867&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Of course, when you limit your email time or increase your response time, you may need to manage the expectations of your colleagues and others. You could say something like this: “I’m slow to respond because I need to prioritize some important projects, but if your message is urgent, send me a text.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1891" rel="noopener">Location 1891&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>As we see it, all that TV time is a gold mine: a large pile of perfectly good hours just lying there, ready to be reclaimed. As usual, all you have to do is change your default. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=1986" rel="noopener">Location 1986&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Nothing’s better for focus than a deadline. When someone else is waiting expectantly for results, it’s a lot easier to get into Laser mode. The trouble is that deadlines are usually for things we dread (like doing taxes), not for things we want to do (like practicing the ukulele). But this is an easy problem to solve. You can invent a deadline. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B078QSCM3V&amp;amp;location=2067" rel="noopener">Location 2067&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>When you’re not sure where to start, try breaking your Highlight into a list of small, easy-to-do bits. For example, if your Highlight is “Plan vacation,” you can explode it into bits like these: Check calendar for vacation dates. Skim guidebook and make list of possible destinations. Discuss destinations with family and choose favorite. Research airfare online. Note that each item includes a verb. Each one is specific. And each one is small and relatively easy. We learned this technique from productivity shaman David Allen, who has this to say about breaking projects into physical actions: Shifting your focus to something that your mind perceives as a doable, completable task will create a real increase in positive energy, direction, and motivation.

&lt;p>If you use the Time Timer when you’re getting into Laser mode, you’ll feel an instant, visceral sense of urgency in a totally good way. By showing you that time is elapsing, the Time Timer will get you to focus on the task at hand. (

&lt;p>Paper improves focus, because you can’t waste time picking the perfect font or searching the Web instead of working on your Highlight. Paper is less intimidating, too—while most software is designed to guide you through a series of steps that will lead to a finished product, paper allows you to find your own way to a cohesive idea. And paper opens up possibilities, because whereas Word is designed for lines of text and PowerPoint is designed for graphs and bullet points, on paper, you can do anything at all. (

&lt;p>Exercise for about twenty minutes… Research shows that the most important cognitive, health, and mood benefits of exercise can be attained in just twenty minutes. …every day… The energy and mood boosts from exercise last about a day, so to feel good every day, get some exercise every day. As an added bonus, daily habits are easier to keep than sometimes habits. (

&lt;p>Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Well, we read Pollan’s books and tried his advice, and darned if it didn’t work. Eating real food—in other words, nonprocessed ingredients Urk would recognize, such as plants, nuts, fish, and meat—made a huge difference in our energy levels. (

&lt;p>What’s interesting in this (at least to us) is that caffeine doesn’t technically give you an energy boost; instead, it blocks you from having an energy dip caused by adenosine-induced sleepiness. But once the caffeine wears off, all that adenosine is still hanging around, ready to pounce. If you don’t recaffeinate, you crash. And over time, your body adjusts to more and more caffeine by producing more and more adenosine to compensate. This is why, if you normally drink lots of caffeine, you probably feel extra groggy and headachy when you don’t have it. (

&lt;p>Wake up without caffeine (in other words, get out of bed, eat breakfast, and start the day without any coffee). Have the first cup between 9:30 and 10:30 a.m. Have the last cup between 1:30 and 2:30 p.m. (

&lt;p>For most folks, cortisol is highest between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., so for ideal morning energy, experiment with having that first cup of coffee at 9:30 a.m. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>What most people (including us before Camille explained it to Jake) don’t realize is that the half-life of caffeine is five to six hours. So if the average person has a coffee at 4 p.m., half the caffeine is out of the bloodstream by 9 or 10 p.m., but the other half is still around. (

&lt;p>Your music, podcast, or audiobook prevents boredom, but boredom creates space for thinking and focus (#57). Take a break and leave your headphones at home. Just listen to the sounds of traffic, or the clack of your keyboard, or your footsteps on the pavement. Resist the itch to fill the blank space. (

&lt;p>It’s a cruel irony of modern life that we’re surrounded by people yet more isolated than ever. This is a big deal, especially if you consider the findings from Harvard’s 75-year Study of Adult Development: People with strong relationships are more likely to live long, healthy, fulfilling lives. We’re not claiming that talking to strangers in the grocery store checkout line will help you live to be 100—but spending time with people face-to-face can be a big energy booster. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Not every person lifts our spirits, of course, but we all know a few people who give us energy most times we talk to them. Here’s a simple experiment to try: Think of one of those energy-giving people. Go out of your way to have a real conversation with her or him. You can talk in person or on the phone, but your voice must be involved. Afterward, note your energy level. (

&lt;p>Even if it’s only once a week, reach out to friends whom you admire, who inspire you, who make you laugh, who let you be yourself. Spending time with interesting, high-energy people is one of the best—and most enjoyable—ways to recharge your battery. (

&lt;p>In contrast to Evergreen notes, Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts. These are very convenient to write, but after a year of writing such notes, they’ll just have a pile of dissociated notes. The notes won’t have added up to anything: they’re more like fuel, written and discarded to help the author process their ongoing experiences.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Digital Journal - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/My-Digital-Journal-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/My-Digital-Journal-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>So if like me, you’re worried about your career, remember that a) some risk is normal, and b) so long as you invest in your skills you’ll become a more valuable asset over time. The problem only comes when we rely on one job for too long, and stop challenging ourselves. That’s when the risk creeps in of becoming a 40-something-year-old who hasn’t upgraded their skills since they were 25.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I’ve changed my opinion on the topic of goals in recent times. I used to think they were a bit pointless in that you’re almost signing up to a contract of unhappiness until you hit the goal. But actually having a goal doesn’t mean you’re wedded to it. And without having some kind of destination to aim for in the first place you’ll never set off on the journey. So if you feel like you’re at a crossroads, just pick something and start moving towards it. It’s much easier to change direction when you’re moving forward rather than when you’re stationary.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>“Every Sunday reflect on how the week previous went and look to see if there are new opportunities that you can be pivoting your goal for” [57:49] I first came across weekly review stuff when I read Getting Things Done by David Allen about 5 years ago - but I’ve done about 4 weekly reviews since then. Grace says that if you want to stick to the practice of weekly reviews you need to make it easy for yourself. It can just be a 10 minute thing you do on your phone at a time that wouldn’t be used for anything useful like during your commute or in my case when I’m sitting on the toilet scrolling twitter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Notion Blogging Kanban - daverupert.com</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/My-Notion-Blogging-Kanban-daverupert.com/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/My-Notion-Blogging-Kanban-daverupert.com/</guid><description>&lt;p>

And she does exactly the same thing when she starts a project. She gets a box, like a literal, like a crate and she just puts things in the box one at a time that she&amp;rsquo;s studying or looking at like a, like a mix tape of music. She might want to use a book, some photos, you know, some some some snapshots Polaroids. Uh, and just stacks things. And she talks about how it creates this almost like history of the project where she wants to know where it started. She just digs down to the bottom and sees that one photograph that sparked the entire dance that she&amp;rsquo;s that she&amp;rsquo;s um you know choreographing. (

But that&amp;rsquo;s not that&amp;rsquo;s not really how it how it works. Um The different parts of the brain can and do take on different functions right to the point that their stories of people losing half their brain like half from accidents or birth defects and they can still lead a normal life. The brain is incredibly plastic, it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly adaptable. Um And so I think that&amp;rsquo;s the biological (

It&amp;rsquo;s like, it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful, it&amp;rsquo;s like patterns and structures and the act of creating categories to me is very satisfying. Um but when I became self employed, I had to train myself and it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to go past organizing and distilling, express. Distilling still to this day is painful for me. I&amp;rsquo;m like, I&amp;rsquo;m cutting, it&amp;rsquo;s like cutting out these ideas that I spent so much time and they&amp;rsquo;re so beautiful and lovely ideas, their precious, they&amp;rsquo;re like my Children, how can I put them aside?

They&amp;rsquo;re good at expressing like my wife Lauren, she&amp;rsquo;s an express her, she&amp;rsquo;s a verbal processor and so what she&amp;rsquo;s done is sort of gone (

&lt;p>Speaker 1: each individual folder is too much to work with. Distilling solves that problem, boil it down. Distill it down. What is the most essential at the level of a folder or a tag? But also even within a note itself. But then you have a final problem which is, wow, you know, this is the moment the turning point I love seeing is when people realized, wait a minute, they look through their second brain, their digital notes and they just realized I have so much that feeling of scarcity, that scarcity mindset in their brain that I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough. I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done enough. I am not good enough. Is just obliterated in the face of the visual evidence that they have a ridiculous abundance of knowledge wealth in front of them. And (

&lt;p>Speaker 0: Oh, this one you get excited about, People say that building a &lt;em>second brain&lt;/em> is about self improvement, but why is that a myth?
Speaker 1: In some ways it is right. When the book comes out, it will most likely be in the &lt;em>self improvement&lt;/em> section. You know, it&amp;rsquo;s about being more effective at life having better results, um being less stressed and doing more with less right productivity, if (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Speaker 1: constraints and deadlines and priorities and things, but just to wake up and do what we feel like, think about what we feel like pursue whatever calls to us, whatever inspires us, right? So to me that I&amp;rsquo;m already anticipating like &lt;em>retirement&lt;/em> or just in the future and thinking, okay, if I&amp;rsquo;m going to have nothing on my mind, I need to start preparing for that, I need to start outsource instead of taking on all the responsibility to myself, doing all the kinds of thinking myself. How can I already start delegating? You know, the most basic kinds of thinking to start to machines, to computers so that over time I can have less on my mind instead of more.
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Speaker 0: what it&amp;rsquo;s good at, which is remembering and you&amp;rsquo;re focused on what you&amp;rsquo;re good at, which is open ended thinking.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s a great point. It&amp;rsquo;s another parallel to &lt;em>Finance&lt;/em>. You know, I never wanted to think about my finances budget save because I thought, oh, that&amp;rsquo;s for retirement, decades from now. But then when you go through really looking at your finances, the benefits are instantaneous. You right away once you start budgeting, let&amp;rsquo;s say, start having &lt;em>less stress&lt;/em>. You know, where your money is coming from, where it&amp;rsquo;s stored, where it&amp;rsquo;s going. You make better decisions, you&amp;rsquo;re less impulsive, you have just a greater sense of security. So it&amp;rsquo;s like you&amp;rsquo;re using that the future projection to make changes that benefit you right now. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Speaker 1: interesting is it&amp;rsquo;s stuff that is first kind of beneath them and they know it it&amp;rsquo;s stuff that anyone could do, right? It&amp;rsquo;s stuff that doesn&amp;rsquo;t add that much value. And it&amp;rsquo;s stuff that is very routine and repeatable, answering emails, scheduling things, you know, uh summarizing their reading, writing up reports or plans or agendas. It&amp;rsquo;s like this kind of just bread and butter of knowledge work that is the perfect target for stuff like the stuff that you want to delegate to your second brain. How can you turn those repeatable low value activities into &lt;em>notes&lt;/em>, into &lt;em>checklists&lt;/em>, into &lt;em>templates&lt;/em>, into &lt;em>models&lt;/em>, into things that don&amp;rsquo;t require you to reinvent them from scratch each time that you can just access the results of your past thinking. Speaker 0: I think one of the things that&amp;rsquo;s such a deep assumption is that in order to achieve more we need to work harder. We need to expel more energy. We need to grind and stuff like that. But what a second brain is is it&amp;rsquo;s about one time actions that have multi time benefits.
Speaker 1: Exactly compounding again finance right? (

&lt;p>Speaker 0: I think there&amp;rsquo;s certain kinds of professions that are early to this. It&amp;rsquo;s people who solve open ended problems, people like writers, like graphic designers, like software engineers, right, who have a an input of different kinds of knowledge over here and then an output of different knowledge over here. But how it gets from the input to the output is a little unclear um but I do think that that (

&lt;p>Speaker 0: visited it before you click there. You have some memory of where on the page that answer is you go through all those steps so quickly that it&amp;rsquo;s as if you know it, even though if I forced you to come up with it without google, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to write. So I think google in a funny way has actually introduced us to this idea of like cognitive extension um more than we realize. But there&amp;rsquo;s a couple things that we can&amp;rsquo;t do. Okay, so a couple things first, Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t have your version of that knowledge, &lt;em>your interpretation&lt;/em>, your take because when you come across a google result you can&amp;rsquo;t edit it. That&amp;rsquo;s control that&amp;rsquo;s owned, that&amp;rsquo;s literally owned and monetized by someone else or some other company. So if you have any interpretation, even if even if that&amp;rsquo;s just you want to put more emphasis on a idea instead of the idea, you can&amp;rsquo;t change it. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing no &lt;em>highlighting&lt;/em>, no &lt;em>reorganizing&lt;/em>, no &lt;em>editing&lt;/em>, no &lt;em>annotating&lt;/em> none of that you can do on that web page. But there&amp;rsquo;s something else too, which is there&amp;rsquo;s this idea in the world of finance of &lt;em>Alpha&lt;/em>, right? This idea that there&amp;rsquo;s certain knowledge that is not universally known, that you can&amp;rsquo;t just do a google search. You can&amp;rsquo;t just look it up either because it&amp;rsquo;s not well distributed, it&amp;rsquo;s not widely known, it&amp;rsquo;s not on the internet, it&amp;rsquo;s only in the minds of certain people, for example, and that&amp;rsquo;s the most valuable knowledge. It&amp;rsquo;s not on the internet, it&amp;rsquo;s only in the minds of certain people, for example, and that&amp;rsquo;s the most valuable knowledge, right? That rare or secret or esoteric knowledge is the best knowledge, precisely because not everyone has it, right? (

&lt;p>Speaker 1: Why is that a myth?
Speaker 0: I really take issue with a comment that sometimes people say, which is I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet implemented your system actually, it bugs me anytime someone says your system. Because what I hear in that, in that comment is this idea that I have figured out the ultimate perfect way for them to be successful. They need to just perfectly copy and mimic my perfect way and I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from the truth. I mean, unless they happen to have my exact life circumstances, my exact same temperament and personality, my same learning style, my same goals, unless they are a, a literal clone of me than my system will not be their system.

&lt;p>Speaker 0: and the memory never fades, never goes away, never gets any weaker. Can you imagine? You know? And there&amp;rsquo;s something else too. I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s a that&amp;rsquo;s an extreme example, but just They they really lose the plot. If you can remember what happened, you know, 30 years ago, the same as yesterday, The level of detail in your head becomes like a noise, nothing gets forgotten, nothing falls away. Everything is front and center. It&amp;rsquo;s like having 50 stereos right in front of you all turned up to maximum volume, right? Um and so I think more and more in the study of the human brain, we&amp;rsquo;re understanding that forgetting is actually a powerful capability and then you go to digital note taking and people are doing everything they can to never ever forget anything ever. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that an interesting paradox? Right? So I&amp;rsquo;m actually curious like I want to know, taking out that has forgetting as a future if you don&amp;rsquo;t access a note or at least you know, change it or edit it or modify or distillate in some way, after a certain period of time it just falls away just gets deleted. And people here that they&amp;rsquo;re like, (

Speaker 1: So tell me once I get inside of second brain, how do you help me figure out where on these various spectrums I am in terms of thinking very analytically, being a bit more creative in terms of being very high in order, being or being like me a little bit more. Okay with randomness. How do you actually help me figure this out
Speaker 0: to s models and experiments? Okay, so the first is models. The one of the very basic ways that humans learn is just mimicking Before you learn to do something original or originally you have to just copy someone, right? So (

&lt;p>Speaker 1: system. It&amp;rsquo;s a second brain that is my system that works for me. And only once you make the system your own are you really beginning to properly build a second brain?
Speaker 0: The way I see that manifested is sometimes people, you know, six months after they finished the course will write me this very long apologetic email and they&amp;rsquo;ll say, I&amp;rsquo;m really sorry I&amp;rsquo;ve made my own system instead of doing it how you do it. I&amp;rsquo;m going to do it this way. And they have these explanations and again, apologies. And so but I really liked what I learned from you and they think they&amp;rsquo;re like offending me. They think they&amp;rsquo;re like going outside of the official holy doctrine. But what they don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that right?

And very practically what I see is that I can be all over the place creatively, because I know that I have the stability of a second brain.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s like you have a &lt;em>chaos budget&lt;/em>, there&amp;rsquo;s only so much chaos any human being can have in their life. So chaos, or let&amp;rsquo;s say, like, serendipity or imagination. So if you want your work to be very imaginative and very spontaneous and very free form and unorthodox, well, the rest of your life has to be Orthodox, it has to be at least somewhat structured. (

&lt;p>Design needs to have a thought process. A purpose. And one of them is to solve a problem. Are we asking ourselves these questions when we jump onto designing?
“Who is this for?”, “How will people use my product” and “Is it actually usable?”&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>“Type can be placed outside of the 4dp grid when it’s centered within a component, such as a button or list item. When placed outside of the grid but centered within a component, text can still appear vertically center-aligned.” — Google Material Design&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you’re using Figma or Adobe XD, things are a little more difficult. Figma and XD are not colour managed, so there is no way to assign or convert profiles for documents. I recommend setting up Figma so the canvas is displayed as sRGB, which helps a little, if you’re working on sRGB designs. It’s an app-wide setting just for the computer you’re making the change on, so other people viewing the document may see different colours.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The difference between good and great is often an extra round of revision.
The person who looks things over a second time will appear smarter or more talented, but actually is just polishing things a bit more.
Take the time to get it right.

&lt;p>Many bloggers and “life-hackers” have made a full-time job of suggesting how you should organize your journal, or how you should most effectively Write about what you read. We should take this advice seriously insofar as those practices have helped the authors achieve meaningful creative work: “Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”

&lt;p>Goal: It’s a chance to break out of the &lt;em>Urgency bias&lt;/em>–where you spend most of your day jumping between emails, calls, meetings, and other low-value, yet urgent tasks–and really zero in on what’s most important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To guide this review, ask a few questions: &lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Did you complete what you set out to do?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Does your calendar (and commitments) match your priorities and values?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>What was your allocation of $10/hour work (i.e. answering emails) vs. $10,000/hour work (i.e. building a new feature)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Create an overarching “theme” for the year that’s tied to your values.&lt;/strong> An annual review should look forward to the next 1, 5, or 10-years as well. How will what you do next year help get you closer to your larger goals? &lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Set you up with a realistic plan for a successful year.&lt;/strong> Use
&lt;a href="https://rescuetime.wpengine.com/smart-goals-examples/" rel="noopener">SMART goals&lt;/a> you can measure throughout the year (not vague wishes and hopes that get dropped by mid-January.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What went well this year?&lt;/strong> &lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What did not go well this year?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Remember: It’s easy to overestimate what you can do in a day and underestimate what you can accomplish in a year!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If I write a note but struggle to summarize it in a sharp title, that’s often a sign that my thinking is muddy or that this note is about several topics (contra Evergreen notes should be atomic). In both cases, the solution is to break the ideas down and write about the bits I understand best first.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Questions also make good note titles because that position creates pressure to make the question get to the core of the matter. Some questions really are evergreen (To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?); others are more ephemeral creative prompts (How might the mnemonic medium enable readers in genres outside platform knowledge?). The goal with the latter type of note is to eventually drop the question mark, refactoring it into declarative/imperative notes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Principles of Note-Taking</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Principles-of-Note-Taking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Principles-of-Note-Taking/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Include &lt;em>the why&lt;/em> When you&amp;rsquo;re reflecting back on your notes, it&amp;rsquo;s often useful to understand not just what you did, but why you did it, and how you felt at the time. Don&amp;rsquo;t just keep a running tally of tasks and facts. Note-taking can help reduce your biases, but only if you instill your notes with emotion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Priorities and GTD</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Priorities-and-GTD/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Priorities-and-GTD/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;em>Kelly Forrister&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How to decide what to do:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Context: What is required to do what you want to do. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have that priority is irrelevant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Time Available: If you don&amp;rsquo;t have time then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter either&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Resources: Do you have the energy to do it?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Priority: Once all of those things have been met then Priority matters.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>When prioritizing ask yourself two questions:
Whats the value in getting this done?
What bad will happen if I don&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you aren’t crystal clear on your priorities, climb up the &lt;em>Horizons of Focus&lt;/em>, especially to &lt;em>Areas of Focus&lt;/em> to know what you are actually responsible for personally and professionally. Many times people will do that and realize they have things on their projects and next actions lists that are not really their job. If you are not sure what your areas are (most people have 5–7 personally and 5–7 professionally) then maybe it’s time for some updates on that with people you think can help you get clear on that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Projects Over Categories</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Projects-Over-Categories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Projects-Over-Categories/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Start by asking for criticism, not by giving it Don’t dish it out before you show you can take it (

&lt;p>Bosses get Radically Candid guidance from their teams not merely by being open to criticism but by actively soliciting it. If a person is bold enough to criticize you, do not critique their criticism. If you see somebody criticizing a peer inappropriately, say something. But if somebody criticizes you inappropriately, your job is to listen with the intent to understand and then to reward the candor. (

&lt;p>My previous experience in such meetings in other countries had been that if I asked a question like, “What could I do or stop doing that would make your lives better?” and then counted to six in my head, somebody would say something. (

&lt;p>JOBS: The most important thing I think you can do for somebody who’s really good and who’s really being counted on is to point out to them when they’re not—when their work isn’t good enough. And to do it very clearly and to articulate why … and to get them back on track. (

&lt;p>though: for criticism to be effective, it’s crucial “to do it very clearly and to articulate why … and to get them back on track.” (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>JOBS: You need to do that in a way that does not call into question your confidence in their abilities but leaves not too much room for interpretation … and that’s a hard thing to do. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Be humble, helpful, offer guidance in person and immediately, praise in public, criticize in private, and don’t personalize. Make it clear that the problem is not due to some unfixable personality flaw. Share stories when you’ve been criticized for something similar. (

&lt;p>JOBS: I don’t mind being wrong. And I’ll admit that I’m wrong a lot. It doesn’t really matter to me too much. What matters to me is that we do the right thing. (

&lt;p>Let’s say you decide to overcome the awkwardness and speak up. You know Alex will be embarrassed when you point out the zipper, but if you say nothing, ten more people will probably see Alex looking ridiculous. So you pull Alex aside and quietly say, “Hey, Alex, your fly is down. I always appreciate when people point it out to me when I’ve done the same thing. I hope you don’t mind my mentioning it.” Your behavior is in the Radical Candor quadrant—both caring personally and challenging directly. (

&lt;p>Instead of asking an implicitly judgmental question like, “Is this a person with high or low potential?” we encouraged managers to ask themselves questions like, “What growth trajectory does each person on my team want to be on right now?” or “Have I given everybody opportunities that are in line with what they really want?” (

&lt;p>Before we try to solve a problem with advanced tools, we have to consider using something simpler which can yield the same result. For example, we can use paper to think, but store the result of that thinking in digital tools. Having many features can distract us from work by fiddling with the tool. The importance of a project is not defined by the tool we’re using to administer it. #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reframing Discipline and Elastic Habits</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Reframing-Discipline-and-Elastic-Habits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Reframing-Discipline-and-Elastic-Habits/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Excessive features often lead to poor information architecture (IA), which makes it harder for new users to experience their first “aha moment,” which ultimately increases the time to value (TTV) and impacts user retention.
IA can be understood as the hierarchical relationship and connections between parts of your product. Good IA is critical as it makes in-product navigation easy and intuitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Features that should be removed fall beneath your team’s designated “minimum usage” threshold or ones that do not correlate with higher retention rates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Respecting Their Time Seth's Blog</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Respecting-Their-Time-Seths-Blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Respecting-Their-Time-Seths-Blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Animals are said to belong to the same species if they tend to mate with each other, giving birth to fertile offspring. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest-time energy. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>And, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still under-developed. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and education. (

&lt;p>Humans emerge from the womb like molten glass from a furnace. They can be spun, stretched and shaped with a surprising degree of freedom. This is why today we can educate our children to become Christian or Buddhist, capitalist or socialist, warlike or peace-loving. (

&lt;p>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00ICN066A&amp;amp;location=371" rel="noopener">Location 371&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>According to this theory Homo sapiens is primarily a social animal. Social cooperation is our key for survival and reproduction. (

&lt;p>The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition. These coalitions play a central part not only during overt struggles for the alpha position, but in almost all day-to-day activities. Members of a coalition spend more time together, share food, and help one another in times of trouble. (

&lt;p>But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust. (

&lt;p>Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. (

&lt;p>an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as the United States and Google.

&lt;p>Research indicates that when people present a balanced picture of themselves, rather than discussing only successes, they come across as more credible and affable. Those with high status, in particular, should acknowledge failures and foibles as well as achievements, not only because such candor is laudable, but also because it makes them less likely to come across as brash, unlikable, and worthy of envy #review&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My colleagues and I have recently found that managers, in particular, benefit from revealing small weaknesses, because it causes their employees to view them as more authentic, which leads to greater trust and motivation. However, the positive effect accrued only when the weakness was relatively mild (“I am nervous about public speaking”) rather than serious (“I’m so nervous about public speaking that I sometimes start to panic”). #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Set Your 2022 Intentions Without Baggage – Curtis McHale</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Set-Your-2022-Intentions-Without-Baggage-Curtis-McHale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Set-Your-2022-Intentions-Without-Baggage-Curtis-McHale/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Your car might not let you switch to Drive unless you press the brake first. That’s because people who weren’t paying attention were slamming their Audis into the walls of their garage, thinking that they were hitting the brake, not the gas. So Audi installed a poka-yoke. It was easier than teaching people how to use the pedals the way they intended. Sending a manuscript to a freelance copyeditor before you submit it to your publisher is a self-built poka-yoke. As is handing over the keys to your partner when you get to a cocktail party. You can add a poka-yoke to just about any system that is fraught, or one where you’re nervous about the outcome.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There’s a healthier way of thinking about creativity that the musician Brian Eno refers to as “scenius.” Under this model, great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals—artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers—who make up an “ecology of talent.” If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of “a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other’s work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00GU2RGGI&amp;amp;location=53" rel="noopener">Location 53&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00GU2RGGI&amp;amp;location=57" rel="noopener">Location 57&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If we forget about genius and think more about how we can nurture and contribute to a scenius, we can adjust our own expectations and the expectations of the worlds we want to accept us. We can stop asking what others can do for us, and start asking what we can do for others. (

&lt;p>Writer David Foster Wallace said that he thought good nonfiction was a chance to “watch somebody reasonably bright but also reasonably average pay far closer attention and think at far more length about all sorts of different stuff than most of us have a chance to in our daily lives.” Amateurs fit the same bill: They’re just regular people who get obsessed by something and spend a ton of time thinking out loud about it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00GU2RGGI&amp;amp;location=83" rel="noopener">Location 83&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The world is changing at such a rapid rate that it’s turning us all into amateurs. Even for professionals, the best way to flourish is to retain an amateur’s spirit and embrace uncertainty and the unknown. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others. Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note of what they’re not sharing. Be on the lookout for voids that you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00GU2RGGI&amp;amp;location=97" rel="noopener">Location 97&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Share what you love, and the people who love the same things will find you. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Become a documentarian of what you do. Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages in your process. Shoot video of you working. This isn’t about making art, it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you. Take advantage of all the cheap, easy tools at your disposal—these days, most of us carry a fully functional multimedia studio around in our smartphones. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Don’t worry about everything you post being perfect. Science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon once said that 90 percent of everything is crap. The same is true of our own work. The trouble is, we don’t always know what’s good and what sucks. That’s why it’s important to get things in front of others and see how they react. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00GU2RGGI&amp;amp;location=235" rel="noopener">Location 235&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Of course, don’t let sharing your work take precedence over actually doing your work. If you’re having a hard time balancing the two, just set a timer for 30 minutes. Once the timer goes off, kick yourself off the Internet and get back to work. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00GU2RGGI&amp;amp;location=243" rel="noopener">Location 243&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you’re unsure about whether to share something, let it sit for 24 hours. Put it in a drawer and walk out the door. The next day, take it out and look at it with fresh eyes. Ask yourself, “Is this helpful? Is it entertaining? Is it something I’d be comfortable with my boss or my mother seeing?” There’s nothing wrong with saving things for later. The save as draft button is like a prophylactic—it might not feel as good in the moment, but you’ll be glad you used it in the morning. (

&lt;p>Don’t think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine. Online, you can become the person you really want to be. Fill your website with your work and your ideas and the stuff you care about. (

&lt;p>If you happened to be wealthy and educated and alive in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, it was fashionable to have a Wunderkammern, a “wonder chamber,” or a “cabinet of curiosities” in your house—a room filled with rare and remarkable objects that served as a kind of external display of your thirst for knowledge of the world. Inside a cabinet of curiosities you might find books, skeletons, jewels, shells, art, plants, minerals, taxidermy specimens, stones, or any other exotic artifact. These collections often juxtaposed both natural and human-made marvels, revealing a kind of mash-up of handiwork by both God and human beings. They were the precursors to what we think of today as the modern museum—a place dedicated to the study of history, nature, and the arts. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>There’s not as big of a difference between collecting and creating as you might think. A lot of the writers I know see the act of reading and the act of writing as existing on opposite ends of the same spectrum: The reading feeds the writing, which feeds the reading. “I’m basically a curator,” says the writer and former bookseller Jonathan Lethem. “Making books has always felt very connected to my bookselling experience, that of wanting to draw people’s attention to things that I liked, to shape things that I liked into new shapes.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00GU2RGGI&amp;amp;location=319" rel="noopener">Location 319&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Our tastes make us what we are, but they can also cast a shadow over our own work. “All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste,” says public radio personality Ira Glass. “But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer.” Before we’re ready to take the leap of sharing our own work with the world, we can share our tastes in the work of others. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Human beings want to know where things came from, how they were made, and who made them. The stories you tell about the work you do have a huge effect on how people feel and what they understand about your work, and how people feel and what they understand about your work affects how they value it. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The way to get over the awkwardness in these situations is to stop treating them as interrogations, and start treating them as opportunities to connect with somebody by honestly and humbly explaining what it is that you do. You should be able to explain your work to a kindergartner, a senior citizen, and everybody in between. Of course, you always need to keep your audience in mind: The way you explain your work to your buddies at the bar is not the way you explain your work to your mother. (

&lt;p>Best of all, when you share your knowledge and your work with others, you receive an education in return. Author Christopher Hitchens said that the great thing about putting out a book is that “it brings you into contact with people whose opinions you should have canvassed before you ever pressed pen to paper. They write to you. They telephone you. They come to your bookstore events and give you things to read that you should have read already.” He said that having his work out in the world was “a free education that goes on for a lifetime.” (

&lt;p>No matter how famous they get, the forward-thinking artists of today aren’t just looking for fans or passive consumers of their work, they’re looking for potential collaborators, or co-conspirators. These artists acknowledge that good work isn’t created in a vacuum, and that the experience of art is always a two-way street, incomplete without feedback. (

&lt;p>If you want fans, you have to be a fan first. If you want to be accepted by a community, you have to first be a good citizen of that community. (

&lt;p>Brancusi practiced what I call The Vampire Test. It’s a simple way to know who you should let in and out of your life. If, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire. Of course, The Vampire Test works on many things in our lives, not just people—you can apply it to jobs, hobbies, places, etc. Vampires cannot be cured. Should you find yourself in the presence of a vampire, be like Brancusi, and banish it from your life forever. (

&lt;p>When you put your work out into the world, you have to be ready for the good, the bad, and the ugly. The more people come across your work, the more criticism you’ll face. Here’s how to take punches: Relax and breathe. The trouble with imaginative people is that we’re good at picturing the worst that could happen to us. Fear is often just the imagination taking a wrong turn. Bad criticism is not the end of the world. As far as I know, no one has ever died from a bad review. Take a deep breath and accept whatever comes. (Consider practicing meditation—it works for me.) (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>You have to remember that your work is something you do, not who you are. This is especially hard for artists to accept, as so much of what they do is personal. Keep close to your family, friends, and the people who love you for you, not just the work. (

&lt;p>Do you have a troll problem? Use the block button on social media sites. Delete nasty comments. My wife is fond of saying, “If someone took a dump in your living room, you wouldn’t let it sit there, would you?” Nasty comments are the same—they should be scooped up and thrown in the trash. (

&lt;p>The model is very simple: They give away great stuff on their sites, they collect emails, and then when they have something remarkable to share or sell, they send an email. You’d be amazed at how well the model works. (

&lt;p>The designer Stefan Sagmeister swears by the power of the sabbatical—every seven years, he shuts down his studio and takes a year off. His thinking is that we dedicate the first 25 years or so of our lives to learning, the next 40 to work, and the last 15 to retirement, so why not take 5 years off retirement and use them to break up the work years? He says the sabbatical has turned out to be invaluable to his work: “Everything that we designed in the seven years following the first sabbatical had its roots in thinking done during that sabbatical.” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00GU2RGGI&amp;amp;location=769" rel="noopener">Location 769&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>So don’t think of it as starting over. Think of it as beginning again. Go back to chapter one—literally!—and become an amateur. Look for something new to learn, and when you find it, dedicate yourself to learning it out in the open. Document your progress and share as you go so that others can learn along with you. Show your work, and when the right people show up, pay close attention to them, because they’ll have a lot to show you. (

&lt;p>Almost all of the people I look up to and try to steal from today, regardless of their profession, have built sharing into their routine. These people aren’t schmoozing at cocktail parties; they’re too busy for that. They’re cranking away in their studios, their laboratories, or their cubicles, but instead of maintaining absolute secrecy and hoarding their work, they’re open about what they’re working on, (

&lt;p>The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something.” Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing. (

&lt;li>Note: Words I need to live by. 70% of life is showing up. I am better than I see myself&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If all this sounds scary or like a lot of work, consider this: One day you’ll be dead. Most of us prefer to ignore this most basic fact of life, but thinking about our inevitable end has a way of putting everything into perspective. (

&lt;p>I’m not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I’m going to make them happen, and if people think I’m an idiot I don’t care.” (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: This is the goal. Care less if people think I&amp;rsquo;m an idiot.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Try it: Start reading the obituaries every morning. Take inspiration from the people who muddled through life before you—they all started out as amateurs, and they got where they were going by making do with what they were given, and having the guts to put themselves out there. Follow their example. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>An artist is supposed to toil in secrecy, keeping her ideas and her work under lock and key, waiting until she has a magnificent product to show for herself before she tries to connect with an audience. “The private details of artmaking are utterly uninteresting to audiences,” (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with this. There is some benefit to keeping some things secret. Some things are not nearly as exciting once you know the secrets of how they are performed. A recent one for me was Youtube editing. Until recently, I just watched and was along for the ride. Now I&amp;rsquo;m analyzing and looking for tricks.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>By letting go of our egos and sharing our process, we allow for the possibility of people having an ongoing connection with us and our work, which helps us move more of our product. (

&lt;p>Spaced repetition systems can be used to program attention, so such mechanisms might be helpful here. In such a system, I might: Sit down to my morning writing and see a small handful of writing prompts for the day, drawn from my writing inbox I can choose to append whatever’s top of mind about any of them (perhaps they obscure what was written previously until I’ve added new material) Once I’ve done that, I can mark the prompt as “fruitful,” meaning it’ll come up again relatively soon, or “unfruitful,” in which case the system will increase its interval substantially. Alternately, I might take a moment to convert one of these prompts into one or more Evergreen notes. Any prompts which I simply ignore will have their intervals increased, but perhaps not as substantially as explicitly-unfruitful prompts. By taking advantage of the exponential nature of spaced repetition intervals, one could make incremental progress on potentially hundreds of prompts, while considering only a few on any given day. This would represent a system for incremental thinking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sql</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Sql/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Sql/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Great leaders&lt;/em>, in contrast, are able to inspire people to act. Those who are able to &lt;em>inspire&lt;/em> give people a sense of purpose or belonging that has little to do with any external &lt;em>incentive&lt;/em> or benefit to be gained. (

&lt;p>Your job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by. (

&lt;p>If I’d waited to know who I was or what I was about before I started “being creative,” well, I’d still be sitting around trying to figure myself out instead of making things. In my experience, it’s in the act of making things and doing our work that we figure out who we are. You’re ready. Start making stuff. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>And you don’t just steal from one of your heroes, you steal from all of them. The writer Wilson Mizner said if you copy from one author, it’s plagiarism, but if you copy from many, it’s research. I once heard the cartoonist Gary Panter say, “If you have one person you’re influenced by, everyone will say you’re the next whoever. But if you rip off a hundred people, everyone will say you’re so original!” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0074QGGK6&amp;amp;location=173" rel="noopener">Location 173&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>What to copy is a little bit trickier. Don’t just steal the style, steal the thinking behind the style. You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes. The reason to copy your heroes and their style is so that you might somehow get a glimpse into their minds. (

&lt;p>Kobe Bryant has admitted that all of his moves on the court were stolen from watching tapes of his heroes. But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized he couldn’t completely pull them off because he didn’t have the same body type as the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his own. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>So: Copy your heroes. Examine where you fall short. What’s in there that makes you different? That’s what you should amplify and transform into your own work. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The best advice is not to write what you know, it’s to write what you like. Write the kind of story you like best—write the story you want to read. The same principle applies to your life and your career: Whenever you’re at a loss for what move to make next, just ask yourself, “What would make a better story?” (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use—do the work you want to see done. (

&lt;p>The computer is really good for editing your ideas, and it’s really good for getting your ideas ready for publishing out into the world, but it’s not really good for generating ideas. (

&lt;p>“The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.” —Jessica Hische (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Step 1: Wonder at something. Step 2: Invite others to wonder with you. You should wonder at the things nobody else is wondering about. If everybody’s wondering about apples, go wonder about oranges. The more open you are about sharing your passions, the closer people will feel to your work. Artists aren’t magicians. There’s no penalty for revealing your secrets. (

&lt;p>I’m always connected, never alone or captive. So, I ride the bus to and from work, even though it’s 20 minutes faster to drive. I go to a barbershop that’s first-come, first-served, without Wi-Fi, and always busy with a wait of a few hours. I keep my laptop shut down at the airport. I hang out in the library. I always carry a book, a pen, and a notepad, and I always enjoy my solitude and temporary captivity. (

&lt;p>Remember “garbage in, garbage out”? You’re only going to be as good as the people you surround yourself with. In the digital space, that means following the best people online—the people who are way smarter and better than you, the people who are doing the really interesting work. Pay attention to what they’re talking about, what they’re doing, what they’re linking to. (

&lt;p>“Find the most talented person in the room, and if it’s not you, go stand next to him. Hang out with him. Try to be helpful.” Ramis was lucky: The most talented person in the room was his friend Bill Murray. If you ever find that you’re the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room.

&lt;p>Occasionally, I have the good fortune to have something take off online, and for a week or two, I’ll be swimming in Tweets and nice e-mails from people discovering my work. It’s pretty wonderful. And disorienting. And a major high. But I always know that high will taper off, and a few weeks down the road I will have a dark day when I want to quit, when I wonder why the heck I even bother with this stuff. That’s why I put every really nice e-mail I get in a special folder. (Nasty e-mails get deleted immediately.) When those dark days roll around and I need a boost, I open that folder and read through a couple e-mails. Then I get back to work. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0074QGGK6&amp;amp;location=496" rel="noopener">Location 496&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself. It seems contradictory, but when it comes to creative work, limitations mean freedom. Write a song on your lunch break. Paint a painting with only one color. Start a business without any start-up capital. Shoot a movie with your iPhone and a few of your friends. Build a machine out of spare parts. Don’t make excuses for not working—make things with the time, space, and materials you have, right now. (

&lt;p>It takes courage to hold yourself and other people accountable, but there&amp;rsquo;s no point in avoiding reality. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Make sure that your goal is clear. Human beings have needs and desires on many levels, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to take the time to think clearly about exactly what it is that you&amp;rsquo;re going after and why you&amp;rsquo;re going to invest the time and effort to get it. Aim high, and aim for something that will enhance your life in the long run. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you convince yourself that you know it all and remain closed off to the ways others see things, you&amp;rsquo;re going to struggle a lot more in life. Merely arguing for the sake of arguing, or insisting on being right, can easily make you blind to the subtleties of each situation – the ones that make all the difference. (

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s okay to make mistakes, but it&amp;rsquo;s unacceptable not to learn from those mistakes. (

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;My most fundamental work principle: Make your passion and your work one and the same and do it with people you want to be with.&amp;rdquo; (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07GPP3R1G&amp;amp;location=304" rel="noopener">Location 304&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If your focus is only on how you appear to others (as either &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bad,&amp;rdquo; or as &amp;ldquo;successful&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;a failure&amp;rdquo;) rather than on achieving your goal, you&amp;rsquo;re actually avoiding reality and playing ego-games. Honest feedback from reliable people is invaluable. It accelerates learning and helps you understand others as well. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07GPP3R1G&amp;amp;location=361" rel="noopener">Location 361&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>When someone challenges your thinking, and you get angry at them, it&amp;rsquo;s a sign that your ego feels threatened. The need to appear knowledgeable, or to be right, is hijacking your pursuit of truth. Even the most intelligent people suffer from it. It&amp;rsquo;s helpful to become more aware of this process that is always at work within you. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B07GPP3R1G&amp;amp;location=496" rel="noopener">Location 496&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>“For me, not telling people what’s really going on so as to protect them from the worries of life is like letting your kids grow into adulthood believing in the Tooth Fairy or Santa Claus. While concealing the truth might make people happier in the short run, it won’t make them smarter or more trusting in the long run.” (

&lt;p>“Meaningful relationships are invaluable for building and sustaining a culture of excellence, because they create the trust and support that people need to push each other to do great things.” (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no point in feeling bad about your mistakes and shortsightedly focusing on the short-term outcomes. It&amp;rsquo;s better to accept failure and look at how that failure can guide your future evolution. (

&lt;p>The person running the meeting needs to run the conversation and needs to be clear about the objectives, the levels of discussion, and the kind of disagreements that will help the process, not hinder it. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Remember, people seldom change on a fundamental level. You can teach someone, guide them, and encourage them, but they will always be the same kind of person at the core. If they lack character or are impractical idealists, there is little hope. (

&lt;p>Choose someone who you want to share your life with – because essentially, that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen. Don&amp;rsquo;t be shy about sharing your &amp;ldquo;warts&amp;rdquo; or the things about your company that you&amp;rsquo;d rather hide; they&amp;rsquo;ll find out soon enough anyway. (

&lt;p>Your metrics are your diagnostic tools, so they need to answer the most important questions and light the warning signals on your dashboard before it&amp;rsquo;s too late to fix a problem. Whenever you solve another problem, also think about how to improve your machine from what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned during the process. (

&lt;p>A well-designed machine takes into account the fact that people are not perfect. In Dalio&amp;rsquo;s view, an organization is built from the top down, so he paid more than the usual attention to hiring the best top-tier people he could find. They, in turn, had to extend the pyramid downwards, designing their parts of the machine along the same principles. This way, everyone in the organization reports to a believable person, someone who has the highest standards. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Each of us has a different reason to get out of bed in the morning, and to work at what we do. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lost in the task at hand and forget about why you love doing your job. To stay motivated, you need to stay connected to your excitement, your passion, and to visualize the things you want to turn into realities. Transferring this enthusiasm to people who work for you isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy. It&amp;rsquo;s a challenge to stay in sync with team members and coordinate your reasons for achieving goals. Sometimes you have to use a carrot and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a stick – but if you&amp;rsquo;re not excited about what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, then you should stop working for it. (

&lt;p>try to climb Mount Everest in one trip. Break everything you do, even your most ambitious goals and dreams into tiny little packets like Lego pieces that you can build no matter how much time you have available each and every day. The eighth principle is that you only know what you make. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to learn and become an expert and know everything before you take action. Taking action is the best way to learn. It&amp;rsquo;s the best way to discover what you don&amp;rsquo;t know to discover what is going to be the most important part of whatever you&amp;rsquo;re creating. Ninth, make it easier for your future self. Your future self matters. They&amp;rsquo;re going to arrive very soon. Very soon you will be them. Package up and (

&lt;p>Our first step is to create a list of Domains. These are the parts of our lives which have no end date and where we must maintain a minimum standard of excellence. (David Allen calls these Horizons of Focus and Tiago Forte calls them Areas of Responsibilities.) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Repeat after me, Domains have no end date and maintain a minimum standard of excellence. Here are some parts of your life that satisfy this criteria:
My family
My finances
My health
My personal growth
My colleagues
My hobbies #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Since we already established that we’ll use Due Dates sparingly, we’ll focus on tagging tasks by:
$10K: High-leverage, high-skill (i.e. recruiting a CMO)
$1,000: Low-leverage, high-skill (i.e. learning a new skill at work)
$100: High-leverage, low-skill (i.e. reading this post)
$10: Low-skill, low-leverage (i.e. getting to inbox zero) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>How on earth will we complete these “Important, but not urgent” tasks if they don’t have due dates? Here’s why the Weekly Review is an indispensable part of any productivity system. The process is simple, once a week (ideally at the same time) you go through every Project and every Domain list and scrutinize each task.
As you go through the lists, ask yourself:
Is this still relevant?
Why is there resistance to this task/project?
What tags can I add to improve discoverability?
Am I actually doing my $10K Work? #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The 4-Hour Chef</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/The-4-Hour-Chef/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/The-4-Hour-Chef/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: what you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it. I call this the “freedom multiplier.” (

&lt;p>If everyone is defining a problem or solving it one way and the results are subpar, this is the time to ask, What if I did the opposite? Don’t follow a model that doesn’t work. If the recipe sucks, it doesn’t matter how good a cook you are. (

&lt;p>“Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it “eventually,” just do it and correct course along the way. (

&lt;p>It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair. (

&lt;p>Eustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for “healthy,” is used in the same sense in the word “euphoria.” Role models who push us to exceed our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth.

&lt;p>Then a funny thing happened. In my undying quest to make myself miserable, I accidentally began to backpedal. As soon as I cut through the vague unease and ambiguous anxiety by defining my nightmare, the worst-case scenario, I wasn’t as worried about taking a trip. Suddenly, I started thinking of simple steps I could take to salvage my remaining resources and get back on track if all hell struck at once. (

&lt;p>What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. (

&lt;p>It’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all. When people suggest you follow your “passion” or your “bliss,” I propose that they are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept: excitement. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;amp;location=887" rel="noopener">Location 887&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>This brings us full circle. The question you should be asking isn’t, “What do I want?” or “What are my goals?” but “What would excite me?” (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you look at my chronology, it is obvious that this didn’t happen until a meltdown forced it, despite the requisite income. Why? The goal wasn’t specific enough. I hadn’t defined alternate activities that would replace the initial workload. Therefore, I just continued working, even though there was no financial need. I needed to feel productive and had no other vehicles. This is how most people work until death: “I’ll just work until I have X dollars and then do what I want.” If you don’t define the “what I want” alternate activities, the X figure will increase indefinitely to avoid the fear-inducing uncertainty of this void.

&lt;p>“I believe that success can be measured in the number of uncomfortable conversations you’re willing to have. I felt that if I could help students overcome the fear of rejection with cold-calling and cold e-mail, it would serve them forever,” (

&lt;p>He e-mailed a Princeton dean asking for it. No response. Two weeks later, he e-mailed the same dean again, defending his request by reminding her that he had previously met Schmidt. The dean said no, but Marrinan refused to give up. He e-mailed her a third time. “Have you ever made an exception?” he asked. The dean finally gave in, he said, and provided him with Schmidt’s e-mail. (

&lt;p>Determine three steps for each of the four dreams in just the 6-month timeline and take the first step now. I’m not a big believer in long-term planning and far-off goals. In fact, I generally set 3-month and 6-month dreamlines. The variables change too much and in-the-future distance becomes an excuse for postponing action. The objective of this exercise isn’t, therefore, to outline every step from start to finish, but to define the end goal, the required vehicle to achieve them (TMI, TDI), and build momentum with critical first steps.

&lt;p>Effectiveness is doing the things that get you closer to your goals. Efficiency is performing a given task (whether important or not) in the most economical manner possible. Being efficient without regard to effectiveness is the default mode of the universe. (

&lt;p>His seminal work, Cours d’economie politique, included a then little-explored “law” of income distribution that would later bear his name: “Pareto’s Law” or the “Pareto Distribution,” in the last decade also popularly called the “80/20 Principle.” (

&lt;p>I was spending 98% of my time chasing the remainder, as the aforementioned 5 ordered regularly without any follow-up calls, persuasion, or cajoling. In other words, I was working because I felt as though I should be doing something from 9–5. I didn’t realize that working every hour from 9–5 isn’t the goal; it’s simply the structure most people use, whether it’s necessary or not. I had a severe case of work-for-work (W4W), the most-hated acronym in the NR vocabulary. (

&lt;p>Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant. Being selective—doing less—is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest. (

&lt;p>It’s easy to get caught in a flood of minutiae, and the key to not feeling rushed is remembering that lack of time is actually lack of priorities. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it’s six days of making a mountain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end product of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you haven’t identified the mission-critical tasks and set aggressive start and end times for their completion, the unimportant becomes the important. Even if you know what’s critical, without deadlines that create focus, the minor tasks forced upon you (or invented, in the case of the entrepreneur) will swell to consume time until another bit of minutiae jumps in to replace it, leaving you at the end of the day with nothing accomplished.

&lt;p>What are the top-three activities that I use to fill time to feel as though I’ve been productive?

&lt;p>Learn to ask, “If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?” Don’t ever arrive at the office or in front of your computer without a clear list of priorities.

&lt;p>There should never be more than two mission-critical items to complete each day. Never. It just isn’t necessary if they’re actually high-impact. If you are stuck trying to decide between multiple items that all seem crucial, as happens to all of us, look at each in turn and ask yourself, If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?

&lt;p>I read the front-page headlines through the newspaper machines as I walk to lunch each day and nothing more. In five years, I haven’t had a single problem due to this selective ignorance.

&lt;p>Time consumers: repetitive tasks or requests that need to be completed but often interrupt high-level work.

&lt;p>Meetings should only be held to make decisions about a predefined situation, not to define the problem. If someone proposes that you meet with them or “set a time to talk on the phone,” ask that person to send you an e-mail with an agenda to define the purpose: (

&lt;li>Note: I am guilty of this. Write the agenda (at least a draft of it) while scheduling the meeting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Don’t give them a chance to bail out. The “thanks in advance” before a retort increases your chances of getting the e-mail. (

&lt;p>Speaking of 30 minutes, if you absolutely cannot stop a meeting or call from happening, define the end time. Do not leave these discussions open-ended, and keep them short. (

&lt;p>My approach was to put headphones on, even if I wasn’t listening to anything. If someone approached me despite this discouragement, I would pretend to be on the phone. I’d put a finger to my lips, say something like, “I hear you,” and then say into the mic, “Can you hold on a second?” Next, I’d turn to the invader and say, “Hi. What can I do for you?” I wouldn’t let them “get back to me” but rather force the person to give me a five-second summary and then send me an e-mail if necessary. (

&lt;p>There is an inescapable setup time for all tasks, large or minuscule in scale. It is often the same for one as it is for a hundred. There is a psychological switching of gears that can require up to 45 minutes to resume a major task that has been interrupted. More than a quarter of each 9–5 period (28%) is consumed by such interruptions. (

&lt;li>Note: We fail at this by having too much information being privledged and only available at the leadership level.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Empowerment failure refers to being unable to accomplish a task without first obtaining permission or information. It is often a case of being micromanaged or micromanaging someone else, both of which consume your time. (

&lt;p>Hi All, I would like to establish a new policy for my account that overrides all others. Keep the customer happy. If it is a problem that takes less than $100 to fix, use your judgment and fix it yourself. This is official written permission and a request to fix all problems that cost under $100 without contacting me. I am no longer your customer; my customers are your customer. Don’t ask me for permission. Do what you think is right, and we’ll make adjustments as we go along. Thank you, Tim Upon close analysis, it became clear that more than 90% of the issues that prompted e-mail could be resolved for less than $20. I reviewed the financial results of their independent decision-making on a weekly basis for four weeks, then a monthly basis, and then on a quarterly basis. It’s amazing how someone’s IQ seems to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them. (

&lt;p>unless something is well-defined and important, no one should do it. Eliminate before you delegate. Never automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined. Otherwise, you waste someone else’s time instead of your own, which now wastes your hard-earned cash. How’s that for incentive to be effective and efficient? Now you’re playing with your own dough. It’s something I want you to get comfortable with, and this baby step is small stakes. (

&lt;p>Commit to memory the following—never use the new hire. Prohibit small-operation VAs from subcontracting work to untested freelancers without your written permission.

&lt;p>Sentences should have one possible interpretation and be suitable for a 2nd-grade reading level. This goes for native speakers as well and will make requests clearer.

&lt;li>Note: Use simple precise words, not illustrative language.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This brings us again to damage control. Request a status update after a few hours of work on a task to ensure that the task is both understood and achievable. Some tasks are, after initial attempts, impossible. (

&lt;p>Use Parkinson’s Law and assign tasks that are to be completed within no more than 72 hours. I have had the best luck with 48 and 24 hours. This is another compelling reason to use a small group (three or more) rather than a single individual who can become overtaxed with last-minute requests from multiple clients. (

Look creatively at your resume, work experience, physical habits, and hobbies and compile a list of all the groups, past and present, that you can associate yourself with.

&lt;p>Use Writer’s Market to identify magazine options outside the bookstores. Narrow the groups from question 1 above to those that are reachable through one or two small magazines. It’s not important that these groups all have a lot of money (e.g., golfers)—only that they spend money (amateur athletes, bass fishermen, etc.) on products of some type. Call these magazines, speak to the advertising directors, and tell them that you are considering advertising; ask them to e-mail their current advertising rate card and include both readership numbers and magazine back-issue samples. Search the back issues for repeat advertisers who sell direct-to-consumer via 800 numbers or websites—the more repeat advertisers, and the more frequent their ads, the more profitable a magazine is for them … and will be for us.

&lt;p>It Should Cost the Customer $50–200. The bulk of companies set prices in the midrange, and that is where the most competition is. Pricing low is shortsighted, because someone else is always willing to sacrifice more profit margin and drive you both bankrupt. Besides perceived value, there are three main benefits to creating a premium, high-end image and charging more than the competition. (

&lt;p>What skills are you interested in that you—and others in your markets—would pay to learn? Become an expert in this skill for yourself and then create a product to teach the same. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>First and foremost, there is a difference between being perceived as an expert and being one. In the context of business, the former is what sells product and the latter, relative to your “minimal customer base,” is what creates good products and prevents returns. (

&lt;p>The M.D. is what I term a “credibility indicator.” The so-called expert with the most credibility indicators, whether acronyms or affiliations, is often the most successful in the marketplace, even if other candidates have more in-depth knowledge. This is a matter of superior positioning, not deception. (

&lt;p>Focus groups are equally misleading. Ask ten people if they would buy your product. Then tell those who said “yes” that you have ten units in your car and ask them to buy. The initial positive responses, given by people who want to be liked and aim to please, become polite refusals as soon as real money is at stake. To get an accurate indicator of commercial viability, don’t ask people if they would buy—ask them to buy. The response to the second is the only one that matters. (

If the visitor presses “continue with order,” it takes them to a page that states, “Unfortunately, we are currently on back order but will contact you as soon as we have product in stock. Thank you for your patience.” This structure allows him to test the first-page ad and his pricing separately. If someone gets to the last page, it is considered an order. (

&lt;p>Before making your final selection, ask for at least three client references and use the following to elicit the negatives: “I understand they’re good, but everyone has weaknesses.

I expect these with all companies, so it’s no big deal, and it’s confidential, of course.” (

In all of these places, it is possible to live well while spending little. I spend less in Tokyo than in California because I know it well.

&lt;p>But there’s more! Retirees get depressed for a second reason, and you will too: social isolation. Offices are good for some things: free bad coffee and complaining thereof, gossip and commiserating, stupid video clips via e-mail with even stupider comments, and meetings that accomplish nothing but kill a few hours with a few laughs. The job itself might be a dead end, but it’s the web of human interactions—the social environment—that keeps us there. Once liberated, this automatic tribal unit disappears, which makes the voices in your head louder. (

&lt;p>What are you good at? What could you be the best at? What makes you happy? What excites you? What makes you feel accomplished and good about yourself?

&lt;p>If you cannot find meaning in your life, it is your responsibility as a human being to create it, whether that is fulfilling dreams or finding work that gives you purpose and self-worth—ideally a combination of both. (

&lt;p>Surround yourself with smiling, positive people who have absolutely nothing to do with work. Create your muses alone if you must, but do not live your life alone. Happiness shared in the form of friendships and love is happiness multiplied. (

&lt;p>As tempting as it is to “just check e-mail for one minute,” I didn’t do it. I know from experience that any problem found in the inbox will linger in the brain for hours or days after you shut down the computer, rendering “free time” useless with preoccupation. It’s the worst of states, where you experience neither relaxation nor productivity. Be focused on work or focused on something else, never in-between. (

&lt;p>Favorite reads of 2008: Zorba the Greek and Seneca: Letters from a Stoic. These are two of the most readable books of practical philosophies I’ve ever had the fortune to encounter. If you have to choose one, get Zorba, but Lucius Seneca will take you further. (

&lt;p>Don’t accept large or costly favors from strangers. This karmic debt will come back to haunt you. If you can’t pass it up, immediately return to karmic neutrality with a gift of your choosing. Repay it before they set the terms for you. Exceptions: über-successful mentors who are making introductions and not laboring on your behalf. (

&lt;p>Slow meals = life. From Daniel Gilbert of Harvard to Martin Seligman of Princeton, the “happiness” (self-reported well-being) researchers seem to agree on one thing: Mealtime with friends and loved ones is a direct predictor of well-being. Have at least one 2-to-3-hour dinner and/or drinks per week—yes, 2–3 hours—with those who make you smile and feel good. I find the afterglow effect to be greatest and longest with groups of five or more. (

&lt;p>Eat a high-protein breakfast within 30 minutes of waking and go for a 10-to-20-minute walk outside afterward, ideally bouncing a handball or tennis ball. This one habit is better than a handful of Prozac in the morning. (Suggested reading: The 3-Minute Slow-Carb Breakfast, (

&lt;li>Do not agree to meetings or calls with no clear agenda or end time. If the desired outcome is defined clearly with a stated objective and agenda listing topics/questions to cover, no meeting or call should last more than 30 minutes.

&lt;p>If you don’t prioritize, everything seems urgent and important. If you define the single most important task for each day, almost nothing seems urgent or important.

&lt;p>Once per week, stop putting out fires for an afternoon and run the numbers to ensure you’re placing effort in high-yield areas: What 20% of customers/products/regions are producing 80% of the profit?

&lt;p>Speaker 1: hard. It&amp;rsquo;s simple because it could be summarized with Write it down Whatever it is, if it&amp;rsquo;s the most hair brained idea. If it&amp;rsquo;s a profound quote, if it&amp;rsquo;s, ah, amazing insight that you had through, ah, book, you read a podcast. You listened to a video you watched. Write that down, write it down before you know if it&amp;rsquo;s good, write it down before you know how you&amp;rsquo;re going to use it. Write it down even if you&amp;rsquo;re certain you&amp;rsquo;re never gonna forget it for the rest of your life. And the reason for that is your mind has a certain carrying capacity. What&amp;rsquo;s known as working memory. If you are trying to hold onto things, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like you know you&amp;rsquo;re coming home from the grocery store and your arms are (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Speaker 1: And it&amp;rsquo;s funny when I say your own ideas, people really differentiate between my ideas and the ideas of others. To me, that distinction almost doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, and the reason is nothing is truly 100% yours, and nothing is truly 100%. Someone else&amp;rsquo;s. Everything that comes into your senses, something you see something, you hear something you touch something you taste is interpreted. This has been the some of the great discoveries of cognitive science in recent decades. Is you interpret everything all the time, So by the time something hits, your prefrontal cortex hits your brain. You&amp;rsquo;ve already interpreted it. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s already yours. So I make no distinction between your ideas and the ideas of others. I just call them ideas. Um, I think people. So wherever those ideas air (

Speaker 1: think you&amp;rsquo;re able to play. You&amp;rsquo;re really able to play. You know, if you look at computers what computers were able to dio, they&amp;rsquo;re able to think in certain very basic ways. They&amp;rsquo;re able to remember things. They&amp;rsquo;re able to do very basic kinds of processing. I think we should give computers those jobs, anything a computer can do. We should just outsource to them and what&amp;rsquo;s left over, I found. And I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this in my students is what Onley humans could dio. It&amp;rsquo;s spontaneity. It&amp;rsquo;s intuition. It&amp;rsquo;s creativity. It is spontaneity. It&amp;rsquo;s responding. It&amp;rsquo;s adapting its playing. It&amp;rsquo;s making jokes being weird. (

&lt;p>The second type of failure the philosophers call ineptitude—because in these instances the knowledge exists, yet we fail to apply it correctly. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Careful studies have shown, for example, that heart attack patients undergoing cardiac balloon therapy should have it done within ninety minutes of arrival at a hospital. After that, survival falls off sharply. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: This must be why Carlee is required to be back to the office so quickly when on call&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>the volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded our individual ability to deliver its benefits correctly, safely, or reliably. Knowledge has both saved us and burdened us. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0030V0PEW&amp;amp;location=181" rel="noopener">Location 181&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The test pilots made their list simple, brief, and to the point—short enough to fit on an index card, with step-by-step checks for takeoff, flight, landing, and taxiing. It had the kind of stuff that all pilots know to do. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Faulty memory and distraction are a particular danger in what engineers call all-or-none processes: whether running to the store to buy ingredients for a cake, preparing an airplane for takeoff, or evaluating a sick person in the hospital, if you miss just one key thing, you might as well not have made the effort at all. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Checklists seem to provide protection against such failures. They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit. They not only offer the possibility of verification but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0030V0PEW&amp;amp;location=453" rel="noopener">Location 453&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>These checklists accomplished what checklists elsewhere have done, Pronovost observed. They helped with memory recall and clearly set out the minimum necessary steps in a process. He was surprised to discover how often even experienced personnel failed to grasp the importance of certain precautions. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0030V0PEW&amp;amp;location=493" rel="noopener">Location 493&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We are besieged by simple problems. In medicine, these are the failures to don a mask when putting in a central line or to recall that one of the ten causes of a flat-line cardiac arrest is a potassium overdose. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0030V0PEW&amp;amp;location=611" rel="noopener">Location 611&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>You want people to make sure to get the stupid stuff right. Yet you also want to leave room for craft and judgment and the ability to respond to unexpected difficulties that arise along the way. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0030V0PEW&amp;amp;location=627" rel="noopener">Location 627&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“If engineers were in charge, every building would be a rectangular box,” Salvia said. Instead, every building is new and individual in ways both small and large—they are complex—and as a result there is often no textbook formula for the problems that come up. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0030V0PEW&amp;amp;location=704" rel="noopener">Location 704&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>There was special color coding, with red items highlighting critical steps that had to be done before other steps could proceed. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0030V0PEW&amp;amp;location=768" rel="noopener">Location 768&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: Shoukd gateway steps in Dorsata Careplan have special handling&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The assumption was that anything could go wrong, anything could get missed. What? Who knows? That’s the nature of complexity. But it was also assumed that, if you got the right people together and had them take a moment to talk things over as a team rather than as individuals, serious problems could be identified and averted. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The philosophy is that you push the power of decision making out to the periphery and away from the center. You give people the room to adapt, based on their experience and expertise. All you ask is that they talk to one another and take responsibility. That is what works. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B0030V0PEW&amp;amp;location=910" rel="noopener">Location 910&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Can be boiled down to a good tweet:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Make checklists for all the &amp;ldquo;simple stuff&amp;rdquo; you have to do so as an expert so it gets done every time. So that you can focus on the things that actually require your expertise.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Bad checklists are vague and imprecise. They are too long; they are hard to use; they are impractical. They are made by desk jockeys with no awareness of the situations in which they are to be deployed. They treat the people using the tools as dumb and try to spell out every single step. They turn people’s brains off rather than turn them on.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Good checklists, on the other hand, are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use even in the most difficult situations. They do not try to spell out everything—a checklist cannot fly a plane. Instead, they provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps—the ones that even the highly skilled professionals using them could miss. Good checklists are, above all, practical.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You must decide whether you want a DOCONFIRM checklist or a READ-DO checklist. With a DO-CONFIRM checklist, he said, team members perform their jobs from memory and experience, often separately. But then they stop. They pause to run the checklist and confirm that everything that was supposed to be done was done. With a READ-DO checklist, on the other hand, people carry out the tasks as they check them off—it’s more like a recipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note:
&lt;a href="https://brandonkboswell.com/Dorsata" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="https://brandonkboswell.com/Dorsata">Dorsata&lt;/a> should aim to be a Do Confirm Checklist&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The wording should be simple and exact, Boorman went on, and use the familiar language of the profession. Even the look of the checklist matters. Ideally, it should fit on one page. It should be free of clutter and unnecessary colors. It should use both uppercase and lowercase text for ease of reading. (He went so far as to recommend using a sans serif type like Helvetica.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: We&amp;rsquo;re checking out so far.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Just ticking boxes is not the ultimate goal here. Embracing a culture of teamwork, discipline, and a shared standard is.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Note: We enable discipline &amp;amp; teamwork and a shared intention.&lt;/li>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Checklists not only ensure disciplined completion of essential steps in any process, no matter how complicated, they can efficiently guide you through those steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Checklists establish a higher standard of baseline performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Checklists seem to provide protection against such failures. They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit. They not only offer the possibility of verification but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance.'&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Checklists seem able to defend anyone, even the experienced, against failure in many more tasks than we realized.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>American society lacks the language to describe itself, and as a result it is incapable of diagnosing and rectifying its own destruction. (

&lt;p>America is built upon ethnocide—the destruction of a people’s culture while keeping the people (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In a language built upon domination and destruction, the meanings of words—and life—become afterthoughts because dominance precedes everything else. (

&lt;p>As a Black man, when I use we most people infer that I am speaking about the Black community, my common people, and not about a we that refers to a collective American people. This is because our society has never aspired to have a common people; if you share commonality you are less likely to create an other whose culture you can destroy and exploit. (

&lt;p>I have never wanted to be white. Being called white felt like the worst insult in the world, not because I thought being white was inherently bad, but because that accusation existed to erase my Blackness. Why should I ever want to be white like them? The statement was, of course, intended as a compliment. They were not trying to harm me; they were trying to explain why and how much they liked me. They aspired to no longer see me as Black, and they would become defensive when I reminded them that I was. Eventually, it became clear to me that I did not have the language to describe these friends. What is the word for a well-meaning person whose language, whose very ideas are not intentionally, but inherently, racist? Whose idea of a compliment is a grave insult built upon cultural erasure. Despite this dynamic being normal throughout most of America, I knew of no words to describe this common occurrence. The onus was not on me to find my voice, but to excavate the concealed meaning of their words. (

&lt;p>America is a society that focuses on action ahead of philosophy and language, and people love to ask What’s next? Americans want to know the actions they can take more than the words they can say or the thoughts they should cultivate. (

&lt;p>In the United States, we have a propensity to coin or reinvent words related to business, which is a problem since businesses will always value profit over people. If our language becomes the language of business, it ceases to be the language of the people. (

&lt;p>l’appel du vide, or the “call of the void.” For years I felt alone in my fear of heights—not of slipping and falling, but of going momentarily insane and jumping off a ledge. This perceived psychological solitude made me wonder if I was actually insane. When I learned of l’appel du vide I felt relieved and more equipped to handle an aspect of life that was so common that the French named it. L’appel du vide is the sensation that you get when you peer over a cliff and a little voice in your head says, “I wonder what it would feel like to jump off.” (

&lt;p>Industrial design: The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer (from the Industrial Design Society of America’s website). (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Interaction design: The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Experience design: The practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=354" rel="noopener">Location 354&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=356" rel="noopener">Location 356&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>

&lt;p>common sense; that is, a lot of valuable knowledge built up over years of experience. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: We often criticize children for lackking common sense, but they havent been given an opportunity to build up this experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=369" rel="noopener">Location 369&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Engineers are trained to think logically. As a result, they come to believe that all people must think this way, and they design their machines accordingly. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=377" rel="noopener">Location 377&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I used to be an engineer, focused upon technical requirements, quite ignorant of people. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=381" rel="noopener">Location 381&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: I think my issue with technical requirements is they distract from the engineer thinking about the user, what they are ttying to do abd their scenario and try to boil that down into a handful of boxes to check. The scenarios are beautiful and complex. Enable the engineer to use their empathy.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>“You are designing for people the way you would like them to be, not for the way they really are.” (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: Our designs should meet our audience where they are. This is why Dorsata has to be intuitive.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>even experts make errors. So we must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=398" rel="noopener">Location 398&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned. Actually, this is where the most satisfaction can arise: when something goes wrong but the machine highlights the problems, then the person understands the issue, takes the proper actions, and the problem is solved. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: If Dorsata let users know what aspect of syncing failed they would be more likely to recover and this would be less likely to be a significant interruption.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Human-centered design is a design philosophy. It means starting with a good understanding of people and the needs that the design is intended to meet. This understanding comes about primarily through observation, for people themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are encountering. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Perceived affordances help people figure out what actions are possible without the need for labels or instructions. I call the signaling component of affordances signifiers. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. (

&lt;p>Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback at all, because it is distracting, uninformative, and in many cases irritating and anxiety-provoking. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Machines that give too much feedback are like backseat drivers. (

&lt;p>“Why is that the goal?” Why was I reading? I was trying to prepare a meal using a new recipe, so I needed to reread it before I started. Reading was thus a subgoal. But cooking was itself a subgoal. I was cooking in order to eat, which had the goal of satisfying my hunger. So the hierarchy of goals is roughly: satisfy hunger; eat; cook; read cookbook; get more light. This is called a root cause analysis: asking “Why?” until the ultimate, fundamental cause of the activity is reached. (

&lt;p>Most innovation is done as an incremental enhancement of existing products. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Conscious attention is necessary to learn most things, but after the initial learning, continued practice and study, sometimes for thousands of hours over a period of years, produces what psychologists call “overlearning,” Once skills have been overlearned, performance appears to be effortless, done automatically, with little or no awareness. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>For designers, the visceral response is about immediate perception: the pleasantness of a mellow, harmonious sound or the jarring, irritating scratch of fingernails on a rough surface. Here is where the style matters: appearances, whether sound or sight, touch or smell, drive the visceral response. This has nothing to do with how usable, effective, or understandable the product is. It is all about attraction or repulsion. Great designers use their aesthetic sensibilities to drive these visceral responses. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=1165" rel="noopener">Location 1165&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Feedback—knowledge of results—is how expectations are resolved and is critical to learning and the development of skilled behavior. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The highest levels of emotions come from the reflective level, for it is here that causes are assigned and where predictions of the future take place. Adding causal elements to experienced events leads to such emotional states as guilt and pride (when we assume ourselves to be the cause) and blame and praise (when others are thought to be the cause). (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=1202" rel="noopener">Location 1202&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>When in the flow state, people lose track of time and the outside environment. They are at one with the task they are performing. The task, moreover, is at just the proper level of difficulty: difficult enough to provide a challenge and require continued attention, but not so difficult that it invokes frustration and anxiety. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=1247" rel="noopener">Location 1247&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The phenomenon called learned helplessness might help explain the self-blame. It refers to the situation in which people experience repeated failure at a task. As a result, they decide that the task cannot be done, at least not by them: they are helpless. They stop trying. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=1361" rel="noopener">Location 1361&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We need to remove the word failure from our vocabulary, replacing it instead with learning experience. To fail is to learn: we learn more from our failures than from our successes. With success, sure, we are pleased, but we often have no idea why we succeeded. With failure, it is often possible to figure out why, to ensure that it will never happen again. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=1387" rel="noopener">Location 1387&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>One design firm, IDEO, has it as a creed: “Fail often, fail fast,” they say, for they know that each failure teaches them a lot about what to do right. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If designers and researchers do not sometimes fail, it is a sign that they are not trying hard enough—they are not thinking the great creative thoughts that will provide breakthroughs in how we do things. It is possible to avoid failure, to always be safe. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00E257T6C&amp;amp;location=1396" rel="noopener">Location 1396&lt;/a>) #review&lt;/p>

&lt;p>•  Do not blame people when they fail to use your products properly.        •  Take people’s difficulties as signifiers of where the product can be improved. (

&lt;p>Eliminate all error messages from electronic or computer systems. Instead, provide help and guidance. (

&lt;p>The designer’s first response was: “Why did you make that error? Didn’t you read the manual?” (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: If the workflow was built correctly, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need a manual.&lt;/li>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>designers should take special pains to make errors as cost-free as possible. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Machines are not people. They can’t communicate and understand the same way we do. This means that their designers have a special obligation to ensure that the behavior of machines is understandable to the people who interact with them. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Many machines are programmed to be very fussy about the form of input they require, where the fussiness is not a requirement of the machine but due to the lack of consideration for people in the design of the software. In other words: inappropriate programming. (

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>One of my self-imposed rules is, “Don’t criticize unless you can do better.” Try to understand how the faulty design might have occurred: try to determine how it could have been done otherwise. Thinking about the causes and possible fixes to bad design should make you better appreciate good design. (

&lt;p>People function through their use of two kinds of knowledge: knowledge of and knowledge how. Knowledge of—what psychologists call declarative knowledge—includes the knowledge of facts and rules. &amp;hellip; Knowledge how—what psychologists call procedural knowledge—is the knowledge that enables a person to be a skilled musician, to return a serve in tennis, or to move the tongue properly when saying the phrase “frightening witches.” Procedural knowledge is difficult or impossible to write down and difficult to teach. It is best taught by demonstration and best learned through practice. &amp;hellip; Procedural knowledge is largely subconscious, residing at the behavioral level of processing. (

&lt;p>What gets confused depends heavily upon history: the aspects that have allowed us to distinguish among the objects in the past. When the rules for discrimination change, people can become confused and make errors. With time, they will adjust and learn to discriminate just fine and may even forget the initial period of confusion. The problem is that in many circumstances, especially one as politically charged as the size, shape, and color of currency, the public’s outrage prevents calm discussion and does not allow for any adjustment time.

&lt;p>Well-learned skills bypass the need for conscious oversight and control: conscious control is only required for initial learning and for dealing with unexpected situations. (

&lt;p>Science deals in truth, practice deals with approximations. Practitioners don’t need truth: they need results relatively quickly that, although inaccurate, are “good enough” for the purpose to which they will be applied. (

&lt;p>Conceptual models are powerful explanatory devices, useful in a variety of circumstances. They do not have to be accurate as long as they lead to the correct behavior in the desired situation. (

&lt;p>It is rare that we need to know the answers to complex arithmetic problems with great precision: almost always, a rough estimate is good enough. When precision is required, use a calculator. That’s what machines are good for: providing great precision. For most purposes, estimates are good enough. Machines should focus on solving arithmetic problems. People should focus on higher-level issues, such as the reason the answer was needed. (

&lt;p>We can’t count on something being present in mind at any particular time, unless it is triggered by some external event or unless we deliberately keep it in mind through constant repetition (which then prevents us from having other conscious thoughts). Out of sight, out of mind. (

&lt;p>Natural mappings are those where the relationship between the controls and the object to be controlled (the burners, in this case) is obvious. Depending upon circumstances, natural mappings will employ spatial cues. (

&lt;p>Build-Measure-Learn. The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere. All successful startup processes should be geared to accelerate that feedback loop. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004J4XGN6&amp;amp;location=201" rel="noopener">Location 201&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: I would argue there is a learning step prior to the build step to save time and money&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>When I worked as a programmer, that meant eight straight hours of programming without interruption. That was a good day. In contrast, if I was interrupted with questions, process, or—heaven forbid—meetings, I felt bad. What did I really accomplish that day? Code and product features were tangible to me; I could see them, understand them, and show them off. Learning, by contrast, is frustratingly intangible. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: This is how a feel these days. I need to find a way to track and document our learnings. We also have to get out our four walls more.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I wish I could say that I was the one to realize our mistake and suggest the solution, but in truth, I was the last to admit the problem. In short, our entire strategic analysis of the market was utterly wrong. We figured this out empirically, through experimentation, rather than through focus groups or market research. Customers could not tell us what they wanted; most, after all, had never heard of 3D avatars. Instead, they revealed the truth through their action or inaction as we struggled to make the product better. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004J4XGN6&amp;amp;location=581" rel="noopener">Location 581&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004J4XGN6&amp;amp;location=652" rel="noopener">Location 652&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: Amen&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>We adopted the view that our job was to find a synthesis between our vision and what customers would accept; it wasn’t to capitulate to what customers thought they wanted or to tell customers what they ought to want. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004J4XGN6&amp;amp;location=685" rel="noopener">Location 685&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: I identify with this, but perhaps steer our customers too much.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>the right way to think about productivity in a startup: not in terms of how much stuff we are building but in terms of how much validated learning we’re getting for our efforts. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004J4XGN6&amp;amp;location=694" rel="noopener">Location 694&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>These are some of the questions teams struggle to answer if they have followed the “let’s just ship a product and see what happens” plan. I call this the “just do it” school of entrepreneurship after Nike’s famous slogan.1 Unfortunately, if the plan is to see what happens, a team is guaranteed to succeed—at seeing what happens—but won’t necessarily gain validated learning. This is one of the most important lessons of the scientific method: if you cannot fail, you cannot learn. (

&lt;p>Most of the volunteering has been of the low-impact variety, involving manual labor, even when the volunteers were highly trained experts. (

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: How can Marshie and I use our unique skills for good?&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The value hypothesis tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once they are using it. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004J4XGN6&amp;amp;location=829" rel="noopener">Location 829&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>For the growth hypothesis, which tests how new customers will discover a product or service, we can do a similar analysis. (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004J4XGN6&amp;amp;location=835" rel="noopener">Location 835&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Instead, I try to push my team to first answer four questions: 1. Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve? 2. If there was a solution, would they buy it? 3. Would they buy it from us? 4. Can we build a solution for that problem?” (
&lt;a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B004J4XGN6&amp;amp;location=872" rel="noopener">Location 872&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Where customers complained about missing features, this suggested that the team was on the right track. The team now had early evidence that those features were in fact important. (

He blew it all because he decided he didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough and instead of bringing an abundance mindset, the opportunity to share the work to other minds, to other people who would be able to amplify it. He hoarded it. And the problem with being a miser is that while you might end up with a bunch of money when you&amp;rsquo;re dead, you don&amp;rsquo;t need a bunch of money when you&amp;rsquo;re dead, what we need is the chance to make things better. And we do that by relentlessly giving away our best work over (

&lt;p>As we come across new ideas and take notes (in Notion, Roam, Apple Notes, a notebook, etc), we can use the Novelty Index to rank those ideas by how novel or exciting they seem at the time. That way, when we look back at our notes, we can always tell which ideas are most exciting to a total beginner. This is often the stuff that’s most worth writing about. Here’s how the Novelty Index works in practice: Take a note when something interests or surprises you, (including when you strongly disagree with something). Write down a score (1-5) of how much it surprised or interested you at the time. Later on, use this ranking system to decide what ideas you should write about. If something was super-novel and exciting to you a few months ago (4 or 5 points), it’s probably a good topic to write about - even if your future self thinks “this is old news - why would I write about that?”.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Painfully Shy Developer's Guide to Networking for a Better Job</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/The-Painfully-Shy-Developers-Guide-to-Networking-for-a-Better-Job/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/The-Painfully-Shy-Developers-Guide-to-Networking-for-a-Better-Job/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Our chief goal with networking events and conferences is simple: begin to build relationships with influencers at our dream companies. Who are influencers?
Senior engineers
Developer evangelists/community relations
Recruiters
Hiring managers
We want to meet these people in a way that is authentic and natural, and then follow up with them #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>When you go to an event or a meetup, do you find yourself awkwardly standing around, compulsively looking at your phone? Do you feel alone or uncomfortable? The truth is, nearly everyone else is feeling the same way. When it comes down to it, people want to feel welcomed and accepted #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Back when I was new to financial sales, I had a very simple strategy for feeling less awkward. I&amp;rsquo;d scan the room to find someone who looked alone and uncomfortable (like me), and smile and introduce myself. Then I&amp;rsquo;d start asking them questions about their business #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Tactic 1: Smile and Say Hi
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s really that easy. This has been my go-to opener for years with people. I walk up to someone, give them a warm smile, offer my hand out, and just say, &amp;ldquo;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Sam! What&amp;rsquo;s your name?&amp;rdquo; If they&amp;rsquo;ve got a name tag, I&amp;rsquo;ll ask something innocuous like, &amp;ldquo;What brings you here?&amp;rdquo; Like I said above, people love to feel welcomed and accepted. #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Take, for example, a &amp;ldquo;tech famous&amp;rdquo; core team contributor of your favorite framework. That person gets bombarded daily with mostly criticism and sometimes abject flattery. Any time I meet someone whose software I use or whose book I loved, I simply smile, shake their hand, and say:
&amp;ldquo;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Sam. I just wanted to take a moment to thank you in person for the work you&amp;rsquo;re doing. It really makes my life easier every day.&amp;rdquo; #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve expressed genuine appreciation, you need to master the art of finding common ground. Your best go-tos are always:
Hobbies (think board games or knitting)
Location (from the same small town in Ohio?)
School (same high school, same college, rival college)
Entertainment (here&amp;rsquo;s your chance to talk about Harry Potter, or sports, or TV shows) #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Never spend more than a few minutes in these interactions #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Take a few minutes to get to know the person, and then say something like this:
&amp;ldquo;Hey, it was really great talking to you for a minute. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few other people I want to be sure to catch before I take off. I&amp;rsquo;d love to keep in touch, though - do you have a card?&amp;rdquo;
I know, I know, we&amp;rsquo;re in tech and people don&amp;rsquo;t often carry cards. That&amp;rsquo;s okay. The point is not the medium itself, the point is that I asked them for a means of following up. Do not just hand them a card or tell them your Twitter handle. They will never follow up with you #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Tactic 6: Follow Up (No one does this!)
Following up is the single most important tactic here, but it requires the most skill. You have to learn how to follow up without being creepy or too persistent. Luckily, this is pretty straightforward.
After a few days, but no more than a week, contact them in their preferred medium. It&amp;rsquo;s this easy:
Subject: Great meeting you! [keep it simple]
Hi Susan,
Just wanted to send you a quick note to say that it was great meeting you at the Famous Tech Conference last week. I bet that Michigan weather is a tough adjustment after all that sunshine. [something personal about them]
Take care, [courteous without being creepy] Sam Julien P.S. My friends are still trying to convince me to play Scythe, but I hear it&amp;rsquo;s even more complicated than Netrunner. I&amp;rsquo;m doomed. [callback to whatever common connection you made]

If they don&amp;rsquo;t respond, that&amp;rsquo;s fine. Not everyone has time to respond to every single email. Hopefully, they&amp;rsquo;ll respond in a friendly tone with similar banter.

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The first principle we look at is the Aesthetic-Usability Effect. Users tend to perceive an aesthetically pleasing design as more usable than its less attractive competitors. A positive response is triggered in people’s brains, causing them to think the design actually works better than it does&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note:
&lt;a href="https://brandonkboswell.com/moc/Design" rel="noopener" class="internal-link" data-src="https://brandonkboswell.com/moc/Design">Design&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Visibility of System Status heuristic states that the design should always keep users informed about what is going on. Appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time is important here, and Peloton does this throughout the user journey. During a workout class there is a bar at the top of the screen that shows where you are in the class at all times, but can be hidden if desired. Every button clicked shows appropriate, instant feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Note: Should we show that the front end is connected and/or how long this chart has been open?
.Design&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Hick’s Law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. Peloton recognizes this and uses a few techniques to counter this. When response times are most critical, they minimize choices. After a workout is complete, Peloton suggests a few cool down/post-workout class options for users to click quickly and efficiently after a workout without spending the time trying to select one of the many options for a post-workout&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Peak-End Rule. This states that people judge an experience based largely on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than an average of how they felt throughout the entire experience. Peloton has placed most emphasis on the peak and end of the user’s journey. At the most intense point of the user journey, you are partaking in a class which is the most enjoyable part of the journey. At its end, you receive a reward for doing your personal best or making any achievements&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Goal-Gradient effect states that the closer you get to a goal, the higher the tendency to approach that goal. Peloton employs two features to encourage users to complete more workouts in relation to this principle. The display of artificial progress helps ensure users will have more motivation to complete tasks. The progress bar at the top of the screen during a workout is broken down into segments, showing you when you’ve hit certain milestones&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Results Equation - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/The-Results-Equation-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/The-Results-Equation-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>One-on-ones are a management tradition at lots of tech companies, perhaps popularized by High Output Management,1 in which a manager regularly schedules time with a direct report to discuss whatever the report wants. #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Alignment—that is, talking through the root causes of any disagreements that have come up. This matters for two reasons. The obvious one is that whoever is wrong about the disagreement will improve their models of the world. The less obvious one is that both participants in the one-on-one get better at imagining what the other person would think about something, which is critical for building a high-trust working relationship. #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Uncertainties. The founders always encouraged me to use 1-on-1s to ask about anything I was uncertain about, even if it didn’t affect my day-to-day work. If anything, I spend more attention worrying about things that don’t affect my day-to-day work (because those are the things I can’t control), so I’d often end up a lot less stressed after these discussions. For the founders, I think these discussions helped them discover problems with internal communication—for instance, occasionally I’d get worried about some strategically important project elsewhere in the company because they’d forgotten to announce progress reports on it. #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I also now think the “caring a lot” qualification is way more important than I used to. Lots of people (including Eve) try having “accountability buddies” that they meet with to discuss progress on their goals, and accountability buddies are rarely this effective. The main difference is that most accountability buddies don’t care about each other in the same way that managers/reports, or significant others, do: for me, Eve’s progress was the top idea in my mind in a way that I doubt it was for anyone else. Because of that, I ended up having more insightful feedback for her than a random “accountability buddy” might. #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>These Questions Are Changing My Life - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/These-Questions-Are-Changing-My-Life-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/These-Questions-Are-Changing-My-Life-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The Kickstart Question: What’s on your mind? This gets to the heart of the conversation. It’s another way of saying let’s talk about the thing that matters most. The person we’re talking to will be relieved on multiple levels: a) we’ve skipped the small talk b) we’re letting them immediately address the main issue c) they’re being listened to. #review&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>A good way for us to deepen the conversation (once we’ve discovered the main problem), is to ask which one of the three P’s they’d like to discuss: a) Project - the technical content of their problem. b) Person - issues with colleagues, family, etc. c) Pattern of behaviour - are they getting in their own way? #review&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>The AWE Question: And what else? Asking and what else? stops us from diving in with advice after hearing someone’s problems. It also gets all of the issues on the table, because the first-level answer to what’s on your mind may not address the biggest issue. #review&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>The Focus Question: What’s the real challenge here for you? Everyone loves fixing problems, ticking them off on the to-do list. But we rarely stop to ask “are we solving the right problem?”* When we ask what’s the real challenge her for you?, we give our conversation partner time to slow down and think about what their real problem is, before they put loads of work into a possibly pointless solution. #review&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>The Lazy Question: How can I help? If we haven’t already got a clear request from asking what do you want, then how can I help should do the trick. More importantly, this question is efficient. It stops us from kind of doing what the other person wants, but not accurately enough that it’s actually useful. #review&lt;/li>

&lt;p>You can use paper to get an order in random ideas by doing doodles, wireframes, mindmaps, diagrams, or what have you. Because of its tactile feel and freeform nature, paper is a better tool for organizing your thoughts. #review&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Digital tools make information easier to search, so they are great to store the results of your thinking that you unraveled using paper.

&lt;p>Instead of a floppy disk, what if we reframed the idea of &amp;ldquo;saving&amp;rdquo; into &amp;ldquo;freezing&amp;rdquo; or taking a snapshot of the current state of a document to come back to at a later point?
That way it becomes less about storage, and more about conciously creating landmarks and iterations

&lt;p>Although our true deadline for completing this project is many weeks or even months away, having such a long time to do the work is actively unhelpful. We’d put it off for ages, then we’d run into logistical issues, then some of us would be on annual leave, all while the very idea of doing the work would be a weight on our shoulders.
Instead, he suggested, we should give ourselves a self-imposed deadline of 3-7 days to complete the next steps of the project. This would avoid unnecessary time wasting, and ensure we actually get the important stuff done.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Heroics are built on &lt;em>trust&lt;/em> and &lt;em>cooperation&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Leaders set the &lt;em>tone&lt;/em> and &lt;em>environment&lt;/em>. When we feel safe we will combine our talents and strengths and work tirelessly to face the challenges of our company. Great &lt;em>leadership&lt;/em> is like child-rearing, but with adults.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Head count vs Heart count&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We should all suffer a little instead of one of us suffer a lot. This in a scenario of necessary cuts to the labor pool they instead required each employee to take 4 weeks unpaid vacation. They could take it anytime and it didn’t have to be consecutive. &lt;em>Morale&lt;/em> actually went up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Leadership is a choice. Leadership is different than &lt;em>authority&lt;/em>. People choose to follow great leaders other have to listen because they have authority over them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When leaders show they are willing to &lt;em>sacrifice&lt;/em> for their people then their people will choose to sacrifice for them to see their &lt;em>vision&lt;/em> come to life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Work, Family, Scene You Can Only Pick Two - RyanHoliday.net</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Work-Family-Scene-You-Can-Only-Pick-Two-RyanHoliday.net/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/Work-Family-Scene-You-Can-Only-Pick-Two-RyanHoliday.net/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>Austin was a little older than me and was already married with kids.  I remember asking him how he made time for it all. “I don’t,” he told me. “The artist’s life is about tradeoffs.” And then he gave me a little rule that has stuck with me always: Work, family, scene. Pick two. Work—that is your creative output. Family—that’s a spouse, kids, or any close personal relationships.  Scene—that’s the fun stuff that comes along with success. Parties. Fancy dinners. Important friends. This is the stuff that looks good on Instagram, that you can brag about, that falls into your lap like a wonderful surprise. Offers, invitations, perks.  It’d be wonderful if you could have it all…but you can’t. #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You Only Know What You Make</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/You-Only-Know-What-You-Make/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/You-Only-Know-What-You-Make/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>of having gotten smarter, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think, actually did get smarter. I think it was kind of an illusion. It was kind of, ah, form of intellectual entertainment. And I just decided, You know what, what do I really care about impressive stats or actually engaging at the deepest levels of these ideas? And it was it was definitely the latter. And so what I decided, really just a year to ago was, What if I read a fraction of the amount of books? What if I said of 30 books a year? I read five or 10 but I completely immerse myself. So that&amp;rsquo;s what I do is I step into the role of the author almost so. I read a summary, but the summary is not just straight quotes. It&amp;rsquo;s not like an exact scientific summary. I actually add my own interpretations. I had my own metaphors that I think sometimes air even better for certain people than the metaphors in the books. I&amp;rsquo;m injecting my own creativity into it. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like I&amp;rsquo;m I&amp;rsquo;m setting myself up as as a &lt;em>pseudo authority&lt;/em>, not on the original subject matter on the original research on the book. I become the (

&lt;p>I typically wait a minimum of 30 mins after market open to consider taking a position so the market has a chance to cool off a little and settle into a trend. Yes, you can leave profits on the table but, your portfolio will thank you for avoiding false breaks/rejections from morning volatility.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🐝 What Bees Have to Do With the Best YouTube Videos - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/-What-Bees-Have-to-Do-With-the-Best-YouTube-Videos-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/-What-Bees-Have-to-Do-With-the-Best-YouTube-Videos-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>You always want to start with a Hook. This is your title, thumbnail, and first 30 seconds of your video. Things that should grab the attention of a potential viewer and keep them watching. Then you move on to the Intro. Once they’ve decided to watch your video, you need to explain the why behind it. Tell your viewers why they should keep watching, what you’re explaining/providing/going to show and how that thing relates to their situation. Next is Value. Throughout the whole video, you want to show the value of your production through elements of writing (video script) and branding (video editing). The point is to make it memorable and to stand out compared to the rest of the productions in the same niche. Here’s where you make them say “Wow, they really took time to make this video special.” And you want to finish it off with the End Screen Sales Pitch. You don’t want to leave your viewers with anything. The best thing you can do is relate the end bit of a video with another video on that correlating topic. Take a look at this video as an example. This way you’ll keep them in a loop and you create a situation where people genuinely want to check out your next video. And given that they’ve already watched one of your videos until the end chances are that they’ll like to watch the next one. #review&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🪂 Focus Hoax What Most Advice Gets Wrong - brandonkboswell@gmail.com - Gmail</title><link>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/-Focus-Hoax-What-Most-Advice-Gets-Wrong-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://brandonkboswell.com/sources/-Focus-Hoax-What-Most-Advice-Gets-Wrong-brandonkboswellgmail.com-Gmail/</guid><description>&lt;p>
