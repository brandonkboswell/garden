This enables you to have multiple fresh looks at the project (and your work on it), and I find that it leads to better overall quality.</p>
<p>I find in design, you can no longer see your work clearly after spending too much time with it. You need to leave it, do something else and re-evaluate it with &ldquo;fresh eyes&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Being able to extend a page beyond A4 size is a huge improvement. Often I am forced to start a new page to continue a thought. Being able to have one page per ideas is very nice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being able to extend a page also opens up a better workflow to have one page per day. Previously, I couldn&rsquo;t fit my notes for a given day on one page, so I didn&rsquo;t attempt this. This works well now!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to scroll pages is excellent, but I wish it remembered my scroll position when I leave the document and come back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new extendable pages now make using the reMarkable in <em>landscape mode</em> desirable. You can get a larger working space while still having as much height as you need. Excellent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landscape mode still doesn&rsquo;t allow you to view the gallery in a landscape orientation. This makes landscape mode feel half-baked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being able to undo and redo actions via a two-finger tap is excellent. The only time I use the eraser now is when I need to erase something I wrote awhile ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of typing in a reMarkable document makes a lot of sense once it&rsquo;s hooked up for typing within the reMarkable app. It is not hooked up yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you try to <em>SSH</em> into your reMarkable, and it closes the connection, you can fix this by remove the host from your known_hosts file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I miss

For 8+ years, I have gone to bed after midnight. For a good portion of this time, I was going to bed around 2am. Only in the last year have I started going to bed reliably before midnight. Now I realize that staying up late (at least for me) is trading your fresh, creative hours in the morning for sluggish robotic hours in the evening. I was wasting my

<p>My ability to think creatively is significantly diminished in the evening, and staying up late to get a few more of those hours at the expense of a productive morning the next morning is just a bad deal.</p>
<p>Staying up late does not produce additional &ldquo;work&rdquo; hours, they are traded against the energy level of the next morning (perhaps the next few mornings, depending on how sleep affects you).</p>

<h2 id="initial-impressions">Initial Impressions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality of life Changes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Charging via <em>Apple Watch</em> charger is a nifty gimmick</li>
<li>Charge chime</li>
<li>Legitimate <em>Find My</em> support</li>
<li>Battery life was already very good, it was nearly never an issue, but it is even better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Better sound quality</strong>
<ul>
<li>Old AirPods Pro were acceptable sound quality. I knew they didn&rsquo;t sound as good as my <em>Hifiman Sundara</em>&rsquo;s but they were so damn convenient and could be open or closed back depending on my use case.</li>
<li>The sounds quality of the new AirPods Pro are actually good. I enjoy listening to music on them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Much better Transparency + Noise Cancelling</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most importantly I work best with a sense of calm. <em>Noise Cancellation</em> is perfect for generating that 





<a
  href="/moc/Focus/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/moc/Focus/">Focus</a>. It is even useful when in a room that is relatively quiet.</li>
<li>It leads to me getting pulled into fewer distractions.</li>
<li>It creates a more intimate interaction with whatever I&rsquo;m doing</li>
<li>One of my greatest tips for achieving flow state and doing deep work</li>
<li>Majority of the time I can&rsquo;t tell whether I have my headphones in or not when in transparency mode. It is that good now.</li>
<li>The pressure people often associate with Noise Cancelling is also gone. It still gives you that isolation but without</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m that weirdo that they built Adaptive Transparency for. I used to weird the AirPods Pro (Gen 1) to concerts just in their &ldquo;Off&rdquo; mode.
<ul>
<li>I recently went to a <em>Landmvrks</em> &amp; <em>Miss May I</em> show with these and wore them the entire time. They stayed in my ears the whole time despite utter chaos and sounded great without the fatigue after the show. They probably aren&rsquo;t technically legitimate ear protection, but if you are one of those people who wants to hear the show and not have tinnitus, it is somewhat of a happy medium.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The connect speed has improved a bit, but don&rsquo;t expect a wholly different AirPods experience. and this is a good segue into my</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons / Wishlist</strong>
* It still suffers from the same issue where you are listening to something on your computer and get a phone call and try to answer it on the phone and the AirPods don&rsquo;t want to switch to the phone.
* Another use-case I have is I will be listening to something on my 





<a
  href="/MacOS/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/MacOS/">Mac</a>, pause it, grab my phone and try to make a call either by Siri or by tapping on my phone and it will try to use the handset audio instead of the AirPods.
* The last one of their use cases is when you receive a call and for whatever reason your AirPods don&rsquo;t pick it up, but then you answer and try to switch the call to AirPods and it&rsquo;s an option, but takes forever to connect or it just never connects and you just sit there why the caller tries to tell you something that you&rsquo;re never going to hear.
* Supposedly the new 





<a
  href="/MacOS/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/MacOS/">MacOS</a> that comes out later this fall gives you full calling and handoff support, hopefully that will solve this rough spot.
* I don&rsquo;t understand the spatial audio trend. It doesn&rsquo;t change or improve the headphones in any significant way, but maybe it will morph into something useful in the future. Perhaps this is all a test bed / precursor for the audio in Apple&rsquo;s upcoming VR/AR headsets, but as of yet it just feels like a gimmick</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>The AirPods Pro Gen 2&rsquo;s are a sizeable upgrade from 2019&rsquo;s initial AirPods Pro. If you are a daily driver of the AirPods Pro or a working professional who uses AirPods to focus, these are an easy upgrade in my book. For me personally, I use the original AirPods each day and these are an easy recommendation. If you aren&rsquo;t using your current AirPods Pro daily or the $250 price tag seems a little steep, then your current AirPods will continue to suffice.</li>

<a
  href="/sources/Building-a-Second-Brain/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/sources/Building-a-Second-Brain/">Building a Second Brain</a> and I think that book has a good explanation of the <em>PARA</em> method and the <em>CODE Method</em>, but should you be using PARA in your 





<a
  href="/Obsidian/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a> vault?</p>
<p>I think the <em>PARA</em> system is good and has merit, but no I don&rsquo;t think it is a great fit for 





<a
  href="/Obsidian/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a> or your modern graph 





<a
  href="/moc/Personal-Knowledge-Management/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/moc/Personal-Knowledge-Management/">PKM</a> systems because it is not flat enough. A file can only be in one folder and I think that makes sense in a traditional file system, but one of the benefits of 





<a
  href="/Obsidian/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a> is that the structure of your files emerges through the references and use of that note via your graph database. To force a traditional folder structure here is limiting the benefits of that system and creating unnecessary effort in maintenance by moving files from folder to folder.</p>
<p>One thing I do use from the <em>PARA</em> method is having a projects folder and enumerating those at the top of 





<a
  href="/Obsidian/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a>. This helps me to keep focus on what I should be working on instead of meandering around my garden. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still do plenty of that, but I&rsquo;m working to have a bit more intention when I&rsquo;m in the garden.</p>
<p>I could see tagging or backlinking your areas so that you could produce a dashboard or dataview of them, but I have operationalized my Areas via my task manager, in this case 





<a
  
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link broken"
  data-src="../Akiflow">Akiflow</a>, as that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going to make sure I meet my expected standard there.</p>
<p>In my opinion, everything in your garden is a resource, so no need for a folder for that.</p>
<p>For me, I avoid the archive in hopes of repurposing any of these project notes as a document in my public garden, but I could see if you are a major user of fleeting notes putting those into an archive.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve mentioned that I don&rsquo;t think <em>PARA</em> is a perfect fit for 





<a
  href="/Obsidian/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a>, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is not useful. It has been amazing in organizing my <em>Google Drive</em>, I recently consolidated and organized all of my local documents and cloud files and I feel very good about <em>PARA</em> for this.</p>
<p>I also use the <em>Arc browser</em> and that also lends itself very nicely to the use of <em>PARA</em>. I have contexts for my different environments (Personal, Work, 





<a
  href="/moc/YouTube/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/moc/YouTube/">moc/YouTube</a>) and projects for each. I can see Areas and Resources working here. If you would like to see more about the <em>Arc browser</em> and how I use it, let me know down in the comments.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve implemented <em>PARA</em> in your life, I would love to hear about your experience and what has worked and what hasn&rsquo;t. Feel free to DM or email me.</p>

Along the way, I will show you 5 tips to have a healthy balance with your phone</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will show you how I have optimized my phone to have more focus and ultimately a more healthy relationship with my phone. Along the way, I will show you 5 tips to have a healthy balance with your phone</p>
<p>Many videos talk about decluttering your phone, and I am in favor of this, but ultimately for a different reason. Everything in your life is vying for your attention, and your phone likely most of all. A big point of emphasis with my iPhone is making it as much of a distraction free tool as it can be. For that reason, aside from the dock, my Home Screen only has 6 apps on it.</p>
<p>Show&rsquo;s the <em>iPhone</em> on Screen w/ the Dock illuminated. There&rsquo;s nothing too crazy on the dock</p>
<h2 id="1-out-of-sight-out-of-mind--intentionality">1. Out of sight, out of mind — Intentionality</h2>
<p>I am a big proponent of out of sight, out of mind. My goal is to have intention when I pick up my <em>iPhone</em>. I don&rsquo;t uninstall distracting apps from my phone, I just make it where my brain has to have intention to open that app. If I want to open Reddit, I&rsquo;m going to search for it. I introduce just that little bit of friction so that I won&rsquo;t get pulled into an addictive open just because I unlocked my phone.</p>
<h2 id="2-add-a-little-friction">2. Add a little friction</h2>
<p>For some apps, hiding the icon on your home screen may not be enough, the ones I have to watch out for are <em>Twitter</em> and <em>Reddit</em>. For those apps, you might want to check out 





<a
  href="/One-Sec/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/One-Sec/">One Sec</a>. It&rsquo;s an app you install on your iPhone and with a little setup it will add a little friction to opening those apps that you can&rsquo;t quite seem to get away from. It gives you a moment to pause and think, does this app align with my goals? The other feature that 





<a
  href="/One-Sec/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/One-Sec/">One Sec</a> has, is the ability to send you a notification if you are still in the app after a certain period of time. So if you are still using the app after say 5 minutes, it will give you a notification in hopes that it will pull you out of the Matrix. 

<a target=“_blank” href="https://apps.apple.com/redeem/?ctx=offercodes&amp;id=1532875441&amp;code=BRANDON15" rel="noopener">You can get 15% off One Sec by using this link</a>. Alternatively, you can use <em>iOS Shortcuts</em> to set a 5-minute timer when you open those addictive apps. That is why I have a clock on my home screen so that I can cancel that timer when I leave. If you&rsquo;re curious about how you can set up this shortcut for yourself, let me know down in the comments and I can put up a video on how to do that.</p>
<h2 id="3-give-yourself-more-rewarding-distractions">3. Give yourself more rewarding distractions</h2>
<p>We can&rsquo;t be distraction free all the time, and for that I put some good distractions at arms reach, if I just need a break from what I&rsquo;m doing. For me, this is 





<a
  href="/Readwise/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Readwise/">Readwise</a> and their new RSS+Read-it-later app 





<a
  
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link broken"
  data-src="../Reader">Reader</a>. So if I just need a break instead of getting pulled into the infinity pool which is Twitter, I can review some key highlights from books or articles I&rsquo;ve read, or read an article I have saved for later. It is like putting healthy snacks out in case you get hungry.</p>
<h2 id="4-turn-off-notifications">4. Turn off notifications</h2>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have to say this, but for those 9 people out there who still have notifications enabled on their iPhone, please go turn them off. This is the equivalent of signing yourself up for spam phone calls in the modern age. The only real exception I have to this rule is my car and my front doorbell. Aside from that, my notifications are off. While we&rsquo;re on the topic of notifications, I highly recommend that you enable iOS&rsquo;s new * Focus Mode* feature. It lets you filter out messages, phone calls and notifications so that you only get important ones while enabled. I have this set up to turn on automatically at 9am when I start my workday. It then runs until noon, turns off for an hour for lunch and then comes back from 1pm to 5pm.</p>
<h2 id="5-avoid-using-your-phone-during-high-productivity-periods">5. Avoid using your phone during high productivity periods</h2>
<p>For me, that&rsquo;s in the morning before work. I have an hour or so that I can do something meaningful with before the workday starts, but if I reach for my iPhone that hour is likely gone. For that reason, I no longer us my iPhone as an alarm clock. I recently bought the 





<a
  href="/Loftie/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Loftie/">Loftie</a> alarm clock and it has given me my mornings back by not having my iPhone be the first thing I&rsquo;m greeted with in the morning. It allows you to avoid the news and twitter and set the tone you want for your day.</p>
<h2 id="6-make-your-phone-less-desirable-at-rest">6. Make your phone less desirable at rest</h2>
<p>This goes back to the your phone is a magnet for your attention. If you put a picture of your partner or your child on lock screen of your phone you are just pulling yourself back into. Its going to suck you back in and drain your willpower. For me I set my background to a black image. That does two things, it makes it less likely I&rsquo;m going to get pulled in and it saves me some battery. As long as you have an iPhone with an <em>OLED</em> screen you save battery by having a black background image because the pixels only have to illuminate when there is color to display. The other thing you can do is set you phone to be grayscale so that the bright colors don&rsquo;t pull you in. It&rsquo;s pretty impractical to leave it in grayscale all of the time, so I have an accessibility shortcut set up where I triple tap the lock button to toggle between grayscale and color. This lets me see the colors of a photo I just took, but not have the home screen be colored while at rest.</p>
<h2 id="7-make-the-iphone-a-great-capture-tool">7. Make the iPhone a great capture tool</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying out this new app <em>Quick Capture</em>. Quick gives you a quick way to jot down a quick note either by hand, photo or verbally. Think of it like <em>Drafts</em>, but it supports dictation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Often times when I&rsquo;m trying to quick capture something I want it to go into my task manager. In my case,

They have the best marketing of all the eInk tablet manufacturers.  I&rsquo;ve tested the 





<a
  href="/Boox-Note-Air-2-Plus/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Boox-Note-Air-2-Plus/">Boox Note Air 2 Plus</a>, the 





<a
  href="/Supernote-A5-X/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Supernote-A5-X/">Supernote A5 X</a> and now the reMarkable 2. In this video I will tell you about the reMarkable 2, how it stacks up against the competitors and who is and isn&rsquo;t a good fit for this device.</p>
<p>When I first started researching eInk tablets, the reMarkable 2 was the first tablet I came across. It was simple, well-designed and looked great. I ultimately passed on it because I didn&rsquo;t like their business model of charging for their connectivity tools, like exporting notes to Google Drive or screen-sharing. It also didn&rsquo;t have a backlight or Kindle support, so I bought the Boox Note Air 2 Plus instead. I did a review on that and after that review I was getting a bunch of questions about how the Boox compared, but I didn&rsquo;t have a point of reference to compare it to so I ultimately bought a reMarkable 2, so I could compare.</p>
<p>For full transparency, this video is NOT sponsored. This is my own personal reMarkable 2 that I paid for with my own money.</p>
<h2 id="form-factor-design--build-quality">Form Factor, Design &amp; Build Quality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Design-wise it is an amazingly designed piece of hardware. It looks and feels premium.
<ul>
<li>These little rubber feet on the back are a nice touch and prevent the device from sliding around the table.</li>
<li>I like the way they hid the charge port in the bottom-left of the device</li>
<li>The sleep button being on the top also feels great.</li>
<li>The white bezels are beautiful.</li>
<li>The device is taller than the Boox, but is thinner. It&rsquo;s only slightly thinner, but you can tell. I really enjoy the form factor of the reMarkable.</li>
<li>I think it feels more premium than the Boox Note Air 2 Plus and significantly more so than the Supernote A5 X.</li>
<li>I love that the sides are less rounded than the Boox so that the magnetic pen actually stays where it&rsquo;s supposed to</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similarly to the Supernote there is no backlight on this device. They do this to minimize the distance between the pen tip and the eInk rendering to make the handwriting more convincing, but I don&rsquo;t find the Boox&rsquo;s backlit display to feel inferior to write on.
<ul>
<li>There is no backlight, but the screen is at least bright white so as long as you have a decent amount of light you will be able to see what is going on well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It does have a glass front and back and is breakable. I would treat this the way I would a laptop. It should go in a padding pocket in your bag if you&rsquo;re going to put it in one.
<ul>
<li>If you want a device that doesn&rsquo;t feel as nice, but can take more abuse, then check out the Supernote A5 X</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="writing-look--feel">Writing Look &amp; Feel</h2>
<ul>
<li>When I first got the reMarkable, I was extremely confused by it. It had ultra low-latency, great tooling and attention to detail, but the handwritten text looked awful. I was perplexed by it and on more than one occasion I wondered to myself &ldquo;why do people like this device?&rdquo; It felt inherently flawed. It turns out the device isn&rsquo;t bad, just the fineliner is. I absolutely hate the writing look and feel of the fineliner. And somehow was the pen that was selected (I think because I like fineliners in real life). Once I found the Ballpoint pen, nearly all of my issues were solved.</li>
<li>The handwriting has extremely low latency. It has the lowest latency of all the devices, and feels great, but I would gladly trade some latency for better anti-aliasing
<ul>
<li>A leaked beta build showed that they were working on anti-aliasing on page turn which would be a very clever way to maintain the low latency while still having great looking and convincing handwriting after the fact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reMarkable has in my opinion the most satisfying writing feel of all the devices.
<ul>
<li>Similar to the Boox, but perhaps a bit more rough.
<ul>
<li>The continuum is reMarkable roughest (traditional pencil), Boox is ever so slightly smoother (mechanical pencil) and the SuperNote is much smoother (gel pen on pad of paper)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Visceral and fluid without any of the fatigue of real paper</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be aware of screen magnitization, when I first got the device I thought I got a bad digitizer because the lines were not lining up with where I was writing (especially near the edges of the device), but I found out the device was just being magnetized by the other devices I was using near it. You can slide your stylus sideways across the device to make this issue go away.  

<a target=“_blank” href="https://github.com/reMarkable/linux/issues/13" rel="noopener">Link to magnetization info</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The software is simple, and that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>You open the device and you have a single list of documents. Some that you created on the device and some that may have imported as PDFs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything about the software feels snappy and responsive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Page flips</li>
<li>The device wakes very quickly</li>
<li>It seems like reMarkable truly uses the device themselves and it feels like it values my time the most of any of the three devices.</li>
<li>I like the keyboard a lot, but it does feel weird that they don&rsquo;t have the handwriting to text like the Boox device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I found myself after a few minutes going, is that it? Is that all it can do, but after using it in practice I love that everything is in one place because it leads to me processing the documents I create instead of them languishing on the device forever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This device is a high-powered notebook, and that&rsquo;s about it</p>
<ul>
<li>This device can do some basic reading of PDFs, but no Kindle support. After using all of these devices, I come to the conclusion that if you want to read a simple novel, just use a Kindle. It&rsquo;s the best experience for that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quick sheets is a lovely way to take a quick note without having to throw it into the wrong notebook. It&rsquo;s a little thing, but a nice touch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per page tagging is very handy. I use it to ensure I transfer all of my important notes back to my source of truth. (Notion for work things and Obsidian for personal)</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also do document level tagging</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from tags there are no clever titles feature or stars for tasks like on the SuperNote, so if you are looking for something to replace your daily planner you should probably look at the SuperNote (I will have my review of that linked above)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The highlighter is beautiful and delightful to use</p>
<ul>
<li>When in PDFs it aligns with the text you&rsquo;re highlighting
<ul>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t found a good off the shelf solution to easily get these highlights off of the device. There is the rmApi project that can successfully pull this data, but the project that attempts to do this appears broken since a recent reMarkable Api update. Here&rsquo;s hoping someone can find a way to integrate it with 





<a
  href="/Readwise/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Readwise/">Readwise</a>. If no one does, I might write something at some point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tablet runs on Linux. For context the Supernote and Boox run on Android. The linux architecture opens up significant room to tinker and I believe is a significant factor in how snappy the device feels.</p>
<ul>
<li>For my particular device I use the DDVK Hack which is a patched firmware to fill in some missing functionality in the base reMarkable UX
<ul>
<li>Quick Tool Switching</li>
<li>Gestures to quick swap between two documents
<ul>
<li>This opens up the ability to read and keep notes in a separate document or two switch between two frequently used notebooks.
<ul>
<li>For example a personal notebook and a work notebook</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability to see your active tool when you disable the UI</li>
<li>Ability to use the eraser button with non-reMarkable stylus (be sure to install the additional stylus hack it is not bundled with the base package)</li>
<li>Easy undo/redo gestures (not as good as SuperNote but still really good)</li>
<li>I turned off the Bookmarking gesture</li>
<li>Out of the box the device is not very left friendly because of the back button in the top right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With the DDVK hacks I think the reMarkable software is very close to as good as Supernote&rsquo;s which I regard as the best when it comes to usability for writing and getting things done.
<ul>
<li>If you aren&rsquo;t, intending on installing the DDVK hacks, then you might find it a little barebones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my opinion, reMarkable has the best companion app of the tablets.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s nice to be able to load up the reMarkable app on my Mac and see all of my notes there instead of having to flip to it on my tablet, if all I want to do is review things.</li>
<li>Synchronization is very quick and I don&rsquo;t find myself having to manually sync. It just works and that is awesome.</li>
<li>You can do this even without the connect membership, but thats a bit moot with reMarkable&rsquo;s recent change to give majority of the connect features for free.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The out-of-the-box templates are plentiful and well-designed. The dot grid template on the reMarkable is better than the default one of the Boox.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have since emulated that template on the Boox and the Supernote</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will note that the reMarkable software hasn&rsquo;t evolved or improved in the time I have had the device. There have been a couple bug fix updates, but that&rsquo;s it. Their team did announce that they have big changes coming towards the end of the year and hopefully that&rsquo;s why we haven&rsquo;t seen any real updates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business-practices">Business Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Putting Google Drive syncing and screensharing behind a monthly fee feels weird and honestly probably loses them some customers. (They have since fixed this as of 9/21/22, Well done reMarkable)</li>
<li>I do like that they don&rsquo;t bundle their stylus in with the device. This brings the overall price of the device down significantly. I think $279 USD if you use a referral code. I will include mine in the description if you decide you want to pick up the device. I don&rsquo;t like that they overcharge for their stylus, making it look like you can get the device for $259, but by the time you get through checkout you are looking at close to $400 dollars because their stylus is $129.
<ul>
<li>Making it so that the Eraser on third-party styluses doesn&rsquo;t work is a slimy way to sell more overpriced Markers. reMarkable if you make your markers worthy of their price people will prefer them over the competing styluses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wish-list">Wish List</h2>
<ul>
<li>I wish I could write in the titles of my notebooks. The Boox does this very well. It&rsquo;s surprising it&rsquo;s not here on the reMarkable</li>
<li>ANTI-ALIASING!</li>
<li>I wish screen-sharing wasn&rsquo;t locked behind a monthly fee. This has been fixed as of 9/21/22</li>
<li>Make other people&rsquo;s stylus work out of the box.</li>
<li>Let me keep my common pens together on the toolbar and also let me have them persist across notebooks</li>
<li>I wish my notebooks were synced in the background on idle instead of having to go to the home screen.</li>
<li>The device is minimalist, and I like minimalism, but this feels a bit too minimalist
<ul>
<li>If I want to move my toolbar to the bottom of the screen I should be able to</li>
<li>I wish there was a way to refresh the screen manually. This device has more ghosting than the Boox or SuperNote. It&rsquo;s not a big deal, but when you get some you are largely helpless to it.</li>
<li>I wish it had a lasso stroke eraser. That is my favorite style of eraser</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I wish it did smart shapes like in GoodNotes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion--who-should-buy-this">Conclusion / Who should buy this?</h2>
<p>The reMarkable 2 is the iPhone of eInk tablets. Its feature-set is limited, but it does the right things and does those very well. The device is very simple and intuitive. Perhaps barebones, but it is the tablet I pick up when I want to think or explore an idea.</p>
<p>If you decide to pick up a reMarkable and consider me a friend, you can use my referral code to save $40.

As a creative (or anyone who likes to solve tough problems), <em>flow state</em> is where you make progress. I sometimes call this <em>Progress Time</em>. Everything else you do is to keep the lights on, and to improve the chances that you find yourself in flow state.</p>
<h2 id="factors-effecting-flow-state">Factors effecting flow state:</h2>
<ul>
<li>getting good sleep the night before</li>
<li>have my to-dos for the day in order so that they aren&rsquo;t nagging at me</li>
<li>know that I have a block of time allotted where I&rsquo;m not going to accidentally miss my next meeting</li>
<li>Coffee (not too much)</li>
<li>Noise cancelling headphones (even if nothing is playing), there is something about separating myself from my surroundings that is especially helpful.
<ul>
<li>The

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-setup">My Setup</h2>
<p>For me, the most reliable way to achieve <em>flow state</em> is to throw in the 

<a target=“_blank” href="https://amzn.to/3yJY1HU" rel="noopener">AirPods Pro</a> headphones and set them to <em>Noise Cancellation</em> and turn on one of the following:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>I have much higher quality headphones than the Airpods, but some combination of the noise cancellation, weightlessness, and the lack of a cable makes a huge difference in helping me focus on what I need to get done. I do find it odd that I can either listen to calm, quiet music or aggressive dubstep and they both enable the same thing, but they do. I find listening to unfamiliar music with forward lyrics difficult for <em>concentration</em>. The noise cancellation is also helpful because I find the constant fan noise of the

<ul>
<li>The progress you are making in your life can sometimes be difficult to see in realtime, but is fairly easy see after the fact if you go look for it. By spending 5 minutes each evening writing about your day you can learn so much about yourself and it&rsquo;s rewarding to look back and see the all the good things that happen in life and your progress.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m constantly amazed how easy it is to forget the great things that happen in life if you don&rsquo;t take a moment to write them down. Often when I sit down for weekly review I will be reminded of great things that I had already forgotten about. Weekly and annual review allow us to keep these things and continue to enjoy them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-basic-intention-setting">How to get started with basic intention setting</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 things you&rsquo;re grateful for.</li>
<li>Pick one daily highlight to focus on for today. 1 simple thing that if you did today, then today would be a success.</li>
<li>Have a spot for notes
<ul>
<li>Capture those as the day goes along</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>End the day with &ldquo;Today was a good day because&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>If you haven&rsquo;t tried it out then check out One Thing, it&rsquo;s this great little app that lets you keep your daily highlight front and center so you can&rsquo;t forget it.</li>

<li>Lows</li>
<li>Learnings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anything you would like to improve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start a document for next week and set 1-2 intentions for the week. Things that you think you can/should do over the next week. They don&rsquo;t have to be big, just something that will have progressed you forward in some small way.</p>
<ul>
<li>For me, it&rsquo;s commonly making sure I release a video, or share a past video for those who may have missed it.

<li>Set a keyboard shortcut to go back a day and forward a day so that you don&rsquo;t have to leave focus mode if you don&rsquo;t want to.</li>
<li>Keep your weekly note somewhere visible so that you don&rsquo;t miss out on your weekly intentions just because they were out of sight-out-of-mind.</li>

I really like the idea of VIM. The ability to move around the page completely with your keyboard is right up my alley. So much so that I use 





<a
  href="/Vimium/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Vimium/">Vimium</a> within Chrome. The ability to find and jump to any element on the page or click on any button with a few keystrokes is amazing. If you&rsquo;re interested in that, I have a video all about 





<a
  href="/Vimium/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Vimium/">Vimium</a>. The issue is that every app you use has to support VIM movements to make the payoff worthwhile. There are tools like <em>kindaVim</em> that try to bring a VIM experience to MacOS, but it still doesn&rsquo;t feel fully baked. We&rsquo;re most of the way there, but you can&rsquo;t use VIM commands in URL fields or to navigate within Electron apps and it&rsquo;s just too painful to have these superpowers and to only be able to use them 80% of the time. Not to mention, I worry a bit about betting my entire ability to work my computer on one app that intends to be paid. It seems like a great way to get held ransom in the future.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure at this point you&rsquo;re like &ldquo;Brandon, if you&rsquo;re so against VIM what are you going to use instead?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m going to use my keyboard, just remapped a bit. The key thing I find myself hating about my current keyboard setup that I have tried to fix with VIM is rapid navigation and selection. I feel like I&rsquo;ve gotten most of the way there by borrowing a handful of navigation commands from <em>Jason Rudolph</em>&rsquo;s 

<a target=“_blank” href="https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard" rel="noopener">Keyboard</a>
which I call 





<a
  href="/Super-Duper-Keyboard/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Super-Duper-Keyboard/">Super Duper Keyboard</a>. It allows me to get Command, Option, Shift and all the arrow keys without having to leave the home row. Yes, this isn&rsquo;t all the power of VIM, but it gets me the parts that I feel I use constantly and I&rsquo;m confident that they work everywhere because it just uses native MacOS cursor navigation just with the convenience of being on the home row.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, as of the time of this writing: I have only been using this for about two weeks, so it&rsquo;s not fully in muscle memory yet, but it feels surprisingly natural.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cursor Movement without leaving the home row</li>
<li>Move a Word forward and back</li>
<li>Move to end of line, beginning of line</li>
<li>Selection with each of them</li>
<li>Lastly, delete a word forward or back (I currently have it on the default of alt+h and alt+l, but I&rsquo;m considering moving those to hyper+h and hyper+l)</li>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been there, that was the exact same situation I was in when I considered publishing my vault. Call me cheap, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I was ready to pay $20 a month for the rest of time. Would I keep writing meaningful content, would people actually ready it?

<p>NOTE: The easiest way to publish your vault online is by using 

<a target=“_blank” href="https://obsidian.md/publish" rel="noopener">Obsidian Publish</a>. I put a bunch of time into figuring out how all of this would work together, and I probably could have saved a bunch of time by just using Obsidian Publish. Either way, I&rsquo;ve learned a ton in setting this up. I also have more control on what does and doesn&rsquo;t get published. I have a ton of private content in my vault and I do not want that being published, which is why I went to all this trouble you&rsquo;re about to see. Yes, I could use multiple vaults, but that seems annoying when you want to link to something that resides in another vault.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking about publishing your 





<a
  href="/Obsidian/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a> Vault online, but you&rsquo;re not sure if you want to pay for <em>Obsidian Publish</em> or not. I&rsquo;ve been there, that was the exact same situation I was in when I considered publishing my vault. Call me cheap, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was ready to pay $20 a month for the rest of time. Would I keep writing meaningful content, would people actually ready it? So instead, I decided I was going to figure out a way to publish my vault without the monthly fee. I now publish my vault online, and I don&rsquo;t pay anything for hosting. <strong>(You are currently reading this article from the digital vault that I publish through this method)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For me, I cobbled together a combination of:
<ul>
<li>

<a target=“_blank” href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz" rel="noopener"><strong>Quartz</strong></a>
<ul>
<li>A nice, clean-looking template for your digital garden that sits on top of <em>Hugo</em>. Once you get your bearings with it, you will find that it is just a <em>Hugo</em> site and you can customize it a ton if you would like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>

<a target=“_blank” href="https://github.com/brandonkboswell/obsidian-export/tree/title_frontmatter" rel="noopener">Obsidian Export</a></strong> (Slightly Modified)
<ul>
<li>A Rust based library for converting your Obsidian Vault to standards compliant <em>Markdown</em> that supports translating Obsidian style links to standard links that are compatible with Hugo.</li>
<li>Quartz and Hugo both assume that all of your files have a title attribute in their frontmatter. Unfortunately, most of my files do not have this title front matter. I have a branch of obsidian-export (linked above) that uses the file&rsquo;s name to generate titles when that frontmatter is not present.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>

<a target=“_blank” href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian" rel="noopener">obsidian-hugo</a></strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Quartz</em> has an easy setup that allows you to commit all of your content to <em>Github</em> and it will compile everything via <em>Github Actions</em>. This is fantastic and super helpful. The issue is I have private content that I don&rsquo;t want on Github.</li>
<li>So instead I use the <em>obsidian-hugo</em> library that Quartz&rsquo;s Github Action uses just I use it on my local machine and precompile the filtered content before uploading to Github. This enables me to host my Digital Garden on Github (for free) without risking private content accidentally leaking out onto the internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<a target=“_blank” href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart" rel="noopener"><strong>Github Pages</strong></a>
<ul>
<li>This is where I publish the content that gets output. It&rsquo;s all static html and is being served by Github. There is no amount of traffic I could ever manage to generate that Github couldn&rsquo;t handle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>obsidian-export</strong> does a very good job of filtering out files and folders you don&rsquo;t want exported</li>
<li>it makes me confident that there is no chance that private data gets uploaded by not even allowing that data to be in the folder that gets parsed</li>
<li>It handles bad or no frontmatter so that the downstream pipeline doesn&rsquo;t have any issues</li>
<li>You can avoid a bunch of hacks to Quartz (and your layout files) by ensuring that your files have title attributes in their frontmatter. I have hacked together a fork of obsidian-export that does this automatically based on the file name when exporting.

<h1 id="high-level-steps-these-are-from-memory-as-i-set-this-up-a-few-months-ago">High Level Steps (these are from memory as I set this up a few months ago)</h1>
<ol>
<li>Clone 

<a target=“_blank” href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz" rel="noopener">Quartz</a> into a local directory</li>
<li>Create a Repo on Github to host your public garden
<ol>
<li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>Make the public folder of your Quartz repo a submodule of that repo
<ol>
<li><code>git submodule add &lt;your_github_project_url&gt; ./public</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Install Hugo for minifying and running a local server
<ol>
<li><code>brew install hugo</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Clone obsidian-export wherever you keep libraries
<ol>
<li>Obsidian Export runs in <em>Rust</em>, so make sure you have Rust enabled on your machine</li>
<li>If I remember correctly, I ran <code>cargo build</code> from the obsidian-export directory to build a local binary that can be called in the compile script</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Clone obsidian-hugo wherever you keep libraries
<ol>
<li>Obsidian-hugo runs in <em>Go</em>, so make sure you have Go enabled on your machine and in your PATH;</li>
<li>The watch/compile script will run <code>go run ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian -input=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/content -output=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/assets/indices -index -root=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz;</code> when it compiles.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Update the compile and watch scripts for the paths of your folders
<ol>
<li>My quartz directory is at: ~/Sites/quartz</li>
<li>My Obsidian Vault is at (My <em>iCloud</em> Folder): ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/bkb</li>
<li>My hugo-obsidian directory is at: ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Configure your configuration files
<ol>
<li><strong>Hugo Config</strong> — quartz/config.toml file</li>
<li><strong>Quartz Config</strong> — data/config.yaml</li>
<li><strong>Quartz Graph Config</strong> — data/graphConfig.yaml</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add a file name <strong>.export-ignore</strong> to your Obsidian Vault
<ol>
<li>Obsidian Export will skip any files / folders you mention here and make sure they don&rsquo;t get handed to Quartz</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t create this file in Obsidian (you likely want to use the finder or a Code Editor).</li>
<li>A sample of my .export-ignore file is further down in this article</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Run the watch script (which will do an initial compile and then watch for changes to your Obsidian Vault)
<ol>
<li>Note that the compile script empties out your quartz/content directory so that files that may have been moved or deleted from your Obsidian Vault do not end up being pushed to the public internet. <strong>Make sure that this path is set correctly before running the watch or compile script.</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Start a hugo server from your quartz directory
<ol>
<li><code>./serve.sh</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Assuming everything worked, you should be able to preview your vault at: localhost:1313</li>
<li>Tinker / tweak for way too long</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re ready you can commit your quartz/public directory to Github pages
<ol>
<li><strong>Verify <em>(especially for the first commit)</em> that there is nothing private that you don&rsquo;t want uploaded to the internet.</strong></li>
<li><code>cd ~/Sites/quartz/public; git add .; git commit -m &quot;Update&quot;; git push origin</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>You probably want to do your ignoring of personal files at the obsidian-export level because if a file is referenced in another file, but that file is flagged as a draft in the frontmatter then hugo-obsidian will have trouble with that and make hugo error on compile with the backlinks. Doing your ignoring of specific files in obsidian-export takes care of this.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve never used <em>Hugo</em> before (like I hadn&rsquo;t prior to this project), you may not know that Hugo has a static folder that generates assets you want to be in any subsequent rebuilds. When I first started this project I added a bunch of lines to the compile script to create files and moving files around when all I really needed to do was add those files to my static folder.</li>
<li>You are going to want to update your Hugo layout files to take advantage of the backlink rendering provided by Obsidian Export. The changes you&rsquo;ll want to make, plus an explanation are available here:

<li>Originally I modified hugo-obsidian to get around the no titles issue, since I now do this in obsidian-export I no longer need to maintain a fork of that code. If it&rsquo;s useful to you, here is the change I made:
<ul>
<li>I had to make a minor modification to obsidian-hugo because it assumes that all of your files have a title attribute in their frontmatter. Unfortunately, most of my files do not have this title front matter. I have a branch of obsidian-hugo that uses the file&rsquo;s name to generate titles if that frontmatter is not present.

<li><strong>Hyper Key</strong>
<ul>
<li>This gives me an extra set of Keyboard Shortcut triggers without having to develop Carpel Tunnel or having to leave my home row. I used to bind many keyboard shortcuts to CTRL+ALT+COMMAND, but then I would have to leave the home row with the right hand which just leads to typing mistakes when trying to migrate back afterwards. Having the hyper key allows me to do those same shortcuts with my pinky finger on my left hand.
<ul>
<li>CAPS_LOCK to HYPER (SHIFT+COMMAND+OPTION+CONTROL) or ESCAPE (If Alone)</li>
<li>Hyper + i/j/k/l == vim directional Keys</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>HJKL Arrow Keys</strong>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the one above. I used to have one of the old Macbook Pros with the inverted T Arrow keys, and then with the unibody Macbooks with no ports they decided to screw that up. I had a ton of muscle memory for getting to those keys and never could get that back since they changed this. So last year I decided that I was going to move my arrow keys to the home row so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to leave it. This configuration also has Hyper + G for beginning of line and Hyper + ; for end of line, but I honestly never use those.  I just use Hyper+Command+H or L, there&rsquo;s too much muscle memory there that I can&rsquo;t seem to give up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shift+Escape to Tilde</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is largely just a symptom of having a 65% keyboard and needing to type a tilde where there&rsquo;s no key for it. This is what I chose. I have more 65% keyboard hacks in my Keyboard itself that I should probably do a video on. Let me know in the comments if you have any interest in that.</li>

<li>Cooking
<ul>
<li>My wife is a far better cook then I, but I do cook a few meals each week. The issue I always found was I would do a meal and then by the time I cook that meal the next time I couldn&rsquo;t remember what I had tried, so I end up making the same mistakes and not progressing at perfecting the dish. So I started creating cooking notes for these and after each time I cook a dish I put another entry into that note. When I go to start cooking that dish again I refer back to what I had written the last time on what to try next.</li>

For instance the script for this video is in there</li>
