Well, there are a number of scientific reasons why, but let&amp;rsquo;s focus on just one of them today, Boredom. When you&amp;rsquo;re in the shower, you don&amp;rsquo;t have your TV, computer, phone. (If I&amp;rsquo;m being honest, I sometimes I have my phone, but I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend that).

Well, there are a number of scientific reasons why, but let&rsquo;s focus on just one of them today, <em><strong>Boredom</strong></em>. When you&rsquo;re in the shower, you don&rsquo;t have your TV, computer, phone. <em>(If I&rsquo;m being honest, I sometimes I have my phone, but I don&rsquo;t recommend that)</em>.

<p>My 2003 Dodge Dakota doesn&rsquo;t connect to my phone and has a pretty terrible sound system. Hell, it doesn&rsquo;t even have cabin air filters (Although I wish it did), but I often find that I get these Shower Thoughts here as well (because I&rsquo;m left alone with my thoughts). So, I will leave you with a simple call-to-action:

  data-src="/blog/The-Case-For-Boredom/">Shower Thoughts</a> don&rsquo;t have to be reserved for just the shower, you can have them anywhere, you just need to have the courage to put down your phone, and not fight the <strong>boredom</strong>.</p>

My use-case is one that rewards focus and creativity. My primary goal is to have a digital sketching and note-taking space that enables me to effortless share what I&amp;rsquo;m sketching in real-time or immediately afterwards with my team.
For me, I feel like the reMarkable 2 does the best job of giving me that creative space and getting out of my way. They also have painless screen-sharing and export baked directly into the platform.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A prompt from a recent

When you&amp;rsquo;re working on a new idea and the possibilities are still endless, the linear flow of modern digital tools is a recipe to build something like the things you&amp;rsquo;ve already built or someone else has already built. Starting with digital also increases the risk of missing the point of the project altogether by working in high fidelity before you&amp;rsquo;ve truly figured out the essence of what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to make.
For years, I used paper notebooks for this step in my process, but about 2 years ago, I gave E-Ink a try, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked back.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>

  data-src="/Analog-Tools/">Analog Tools</a>, combined with digital portability and collaboration. As a User Experience designer, there are often times when I have an image in mind or even on my sketchbook, but I&rsquo;m trying to discuss it with one of my coworkers via Zoom. Not only can they not see what&rsquo;s in my mind, they also can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s in my sketchbook. I&rsquo;m effectively left with just my words to try to communicate the vision for this idea. With E-Ink, I can share my drawing screen in real-time with my colleague and that person can see exactly what I see. If a detail about the sketch isn&rsquo;t quite right (or I haven&rsquo;t explored that detail yet), we can explore that together. E-Ink can bridge the gaps created by a remote workforce. When I&rsquo;m done with this step in the process, I can share the result with others without having to rip the page out of my notebook or find a camera or scanner.</p>

Being able to extend a page beyond A4 size is a huge improvement. Often I am forced to start a new page to continue a thought. Being able to have one page per ideas is very nice.
Being able to extend a page also opens up a better workflow to have one page per day. Previously, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fit my notes for a given day on one page, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t attempt this. This works well now!
The ability to scroll pages is excellent, but I wish it remembered my scroll position when I leave the document and come back.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the <em>reMarkable</em> 3.0 Beta for the past week. Here are my initial impressions.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to scroll pages is excellent, but I wish it remembered my scroll position when I leave the document and come back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new extendable pages now make using the reMarkable in <em>landscape mode</em> desirable. You can get a larger working space while still having as much height as you need. Excellent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landscape mode still doesn&rsquo;t allow you to view the gallery in a landscape orientation. This makes landscape mode feel half-baked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being able to undo and redo actions via a two-finger tap is excellent. The only time I use the eraser now is when I need to erase something I wrote awhile ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of typing in a reMarkable document makes a lot of sense once it&rsquo;s hooked up for typing within the reMarkable app. It is not hooked up yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you try to <em>SSH</em> into your reMarkable, and it closes the connection, you can fix this by remove the host from your known_hosts file.</p>

<li>Charging via <em>Apple Watch</em> charger is a nifty gimmick</li>
<li>Charge chime</li>
<li>Legitimate <em>Find My</em> support</li>
<li>Battery life was already very good, it was nearly never an issue, but it is even better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Better sound quality</strong>
<ul>
<li>Old AirPods Pro were acceptable sound quality. I knew they didn&rsquo;t sound as good as my <em>Hifiman Sundara</em>&rsquo;s but they were so damn convenient and could be open or closed back depending on my use case.</li>
<li>The sounds quality of the new AirPods Pro are actually good. I enjoy listening to music on them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Much better Transparency + Noise Cancelling</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most importantly I work best with a sense of calm. <em>Noise Cancellation</em> is perfect for generating that 





<a
  href="/moc/Focus/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/moc/Focus/">Focus</a>. It is even useful when in a room that is relatively quiet.</li>
<li>It leads to me getting pulled into fewer distractions.</li>
<li>It creates a more intimate interaction with whatever I&rsquo;m doing</li>
<li>One of my greatest tips for achieving flow state and doing deep work</li>
<li>Majority of the time I can&rsquo;t tell whether I have my headphones in or not when in transparency mode. It is that good now.</li>
<li>The pressure people often associate with Noise Cancelling is also gone. It still gives you that isolation but without</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m that weirdo that they built Adaptive Transparency for. I used to weird the AirPods Pro (Gen 1) to concerts just in their &ldquo;Off&rdquo; mode.
<ul>
<li>I recently went to a <em>Landmvrks</em> &amp; <em>Miss May I</em> show with these and wore them the entire time. They stayed in my ears the whole time despite utter chaos and sounded great without the fatigue after the show. They probably aren&rsquo;t technically legitimate ear protection, but if you are one of those people who wants to hear the show and not have tinnitus, it is somewhat of a happy medium.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The connect speed has improved a bit, but don&rsquo;t expect a wholly different AirPods experience. and this is a good segue into my</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons / Wishlist</strong>
* It still suffers from the same issue where you are listening to something on your computer and get a phone call and try to answer it on the phone and the AirPods don&rsquo;t want to switch to the phone.
* Another use-case I have is I will be listening to something on my 





<a
  href="/MacOS/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/MacOS/">Mac</a>, pause it, grab my phone and try to make a call either by Siri or by tapping on my phone and it will try to use the handset audio instead of the AirPods.
* The last one of their use cases is when you receive a call and for whatever reason your AirPods don&rsquo;t pick it up, but then you answer and try to switch the call to AirPods and it&rsquo;s an option, but takes forever to connect or it just never connects and you just sit there why the caller tries to tell you something that you&rsquo;re never going to hear.
* Supposedly the new 





<a
  href="/MacOS/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/MacOS/">MacOS</a> that comes out later this fall gives you full calling and handoff support, hopefully that will solve this rough spot.
* I don&rsquo;t understand the spatial audio trend. It doesn&rsquo;t change or improve the headphones in any significant way, but maybe it will morph into something useful in the future. Perhaps this is all a test bed / precursor for the audio in Apple&rsquo;s upcoming VR/AR headsets, but as of yet it just feels like a gimmick</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>The AirPods Pro Gen 2&rsquo;s are a sizeable upgrade from 2019&rsquo;s initial AirPods Pro. If you are a daily driver of the AirPods Pro or a working professional who uses AirPods to focus, these are an easy upgrade in my book. For me personally, I use the original AirPods each day and these are an easy recommendation. If you aren&rsquo;t using your current AirPods Pro daily or the $250 price tag seems a little steep, then your current AirPods will continue to suffice.</li>

I think the PARA system is good and has merit, but no I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is a great fit for Obsidian or your modern graph PKM systems because it is not flat enough. A file can only be in one folder and I think that makes sense in a traditional file system, but one of the benefits of Obsidian is that the structure of your files emerges through the references and use of that note via your graph database.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently read <em>Tiago Forte</em>&rsquo;s

<a

  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a> is that the structure of your files emerges through the references and use of that note via your graph database. To force a traditional folder structure here is limiting the benefits of that system and creating unnecessary effort in maintenance by moving files from folder to folder.</p>
<p>One thing I do use from the <em>PARA</em> method is having a projects folder and enumerating those at the top of 





<a
  href="/Obsidian/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a>. This helps me to keep focus on what I should be working on instead of meandering around my garden. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still do plenty of that, but I&rsquo;m working to have a bit more intention when I&rsquo;m in the garden.</p>
<p>I could see tagging or backlinking your areas so that you could produce a dashboard or dataview of them, but I have operationalized my Areas via my task manager, in this case 





<a
  
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link broken"
  data-src="../Akiflow">Akiflow</a>, as that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going to make sure I meet my expected standard there.</p>
<p>In my opinion, everything in your garden is a resource, so no need for a folder for that.</p>
<p>For me, I avoid the archive in hopes of repurposing any of these project notes as a document in my public garden, but I could see if you are a major user of fleeting notes putting those into an archive.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve mentioned that I don&rsquo;t think <em>PARA</em> is a perfect fit for 





<a
  href="/Obsidian/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a>, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is not useful. It has been amazing in organizing my <em>Google Drive</em>, I recently consolidated and organized all of my local documents and cloud files and I feel very good about <em>PARA</em> for this.</p>
<p>I also use the <em>Arc browser</em> and that also lends itself very nicely to the use of <em>PARA</em>. I have contexts for my different environments (Personal, Work, 





<a

Everything in your life is vying for your attention, and your phone likely most of all. A big point of emphasis with my iPhone is making it as much of a distraction free tool as it can be.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will show you how I have optimized my phone to have more focus and ultimately a more healthy relationship with my phone. Along the way, I will show you 5 tips to have a healthy balance with your phone</p>
<p>Many videos talk about decluttering your phone, and I am in favor of this, but ultimately for a different reason. Everything in your life is vying for your attention, and your phone likely most of all. A big point of emphasis with my iPhone is making it as much of a distraction free tool as it can be. For that reason, aside from the dock, my Home Screen only has 6 apps on it.</p>
<p>Show&rsquo;s the <em>iPhone</em> on Screen w/ the Dock illuminated. There&rsquo;s nothing too crazy on the dock</p>
<h2 id="1-out-of-sight-out-of-mind--intentionality">1. Out of sight, out of mind — Intentionality</h2>
<p>I am a big proponent of out of sight, out of mind. My goal is to have intention when I pick up my <em>iPhone</em>. I don&rsquo;t uninstall distracting apps from my phone, I just make it where my brain has to have intention to open that app. If I want to open Reddit, I&rsquo;m going to search for it. I introduce just that little bit of friction so that I won&rsquo;t get pulled into an addictive open just because I unlocked my phone.</p>
<h2 id="2-add-a-little-friction">2. Add a little friction</h2>
<p>For some apps, hiding the icon on your home screen may not be enough, the ones I have to watch out for are 





<a
  href="/Twitter/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Twitter/">Twitter</a> and <em>Reddit</em>. For those apps, you might want to check out 





<a
  href="/One-Sec/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/One-Sec/">One Sec</a>. It&rsquo;s an app you install on your iPhone and with a little setup it will add a little friction to opening those apps that you can&rsquo;t quite seem to get away from. It gives you a moment to pause and think, does this app align with my goals? The other feature that 





<a
  href="/One-Sec/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/One-Sec/">One Sec</a> has, is the ability to send you a notification if you are still in the app after a certain period of time. So if you are still using the app after say 5 minutes, it will give you a notification in hopes that it will pull you out of the Matrix. 

<a target=“_blank” href="https://apps.apple.com/redeem/?ctx=offercodes&amp;id=1532875441&amp;code=BRANDON15" rel="noopener">You can get 15% off One Sec by using this link</a>. Alternatively, you can use <em>iOS Shortcuts</em> to set a 5-minute timer when you open those addictive apps. That is why I have a clock on my home screen so that I can cancel that timer when I leave. If you&rsquo;re curious about how you can set up this shortcut for yourself, let me know down in the comments and I can put up a video on how to do that.</p>
<h2 id="3-give-yourself-more-rewarding-distractions">3. Give yourself more rewarding distractions</h2>
<p>We can&rsquo;t be distraction free all the time, and for that I put some good distractions at arms reach, if I just need a break from what I&rsquo;m doing. For me, this is 





<a
  href="/Readwise/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Readwise/">Readwise</a> and their new RSS+Read-it-later app 





<a
  href="/Readwise-Reader/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Readwise-Reader/">Readwise Reader</a>. So if I just need a break instead of getting pulled into the infinity pool which is Twitter, I can review some key highlights from books or articles I&rsquo;ve read, or read an article I have saved for later. It is like putting healthy snacks out in case you get hungry.</p>
<h2 id="4-turn-off-notifications">4. Turn off notifications</h2>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have to say this, but for those 9 people out there who still have notifications enabled on their iPhone, please go turn them off. This is the equivalent of signing yourself up for spam phone calls in the modern age. The only real exception I have to this rule is my car and my front doorbell. Aside from that, my notifications are off. While we&rsquo;re on the topic of notifications, I highly recommend that you enable iOS&rsquo;s new * Focus Mode* feature. It lets you filter out messages, phone calls and notifications so that you only get important ones while enabled. I have this set up to turn on automatically at 9am when I start my workday. It then runs until noon, turns off for an hour for lunch and then comes back from 1pm to 5pm.</p>
<h2 id="5-avoid-using-your-phone-during-high-productivity-periods">5. Avoid using your phone during high productivity periods</h2>
<p>For me, that&rsquo;s in the morning before work. I have an hour or so that I can do something meaningful with before the workday starts, but if I reach for my iPhone that hour is likely gone. For that reason, I no longer us my iPhone as an alarm clock. I recently bought the 





<a

  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Loftie/">Loftie</a> alarm clock and it has given me my mornings back by not having my iPhone be the first thing I&rsquo;m greeted with in the morning. It allows you to avoid the news and twitter and set the tone you want for your day.</p>
<h2 id="6-make-your-phone-less-desirable-at-rest">6. Make your phone less desirable at rest</h2>
<p>This goes back to the your phone is a magnet for your attention. If you put a picture of your partner or your child on lock screen of your phone you are just pulling yourself back into. Its going to suck you back in and drain your willpower. For me I set my background to a black image. That does two things, it makes it less likely I&rsquo;m going to get pulled in and it saves me some battery. As long as you have an iPhone with an <em>OLED</em> screen you save battery by having a black background image because the pixels only have to illuminate when there is color to display. The other thing you can do is set you phone to be grayscale so that the bright colors don&rsquo;t pull you in. It&rsquo;s pretty impractical to leave it in grayscale all of the time, so I have an accessibility shortcut set up where I triple tap the lock button to toggle between grayscale and color. This lets me see the colors of a photo I just took, but not have the home screen be colored while at rest.</p>
<h2 id="7-make-the-iphone-a-great-capture-tool">7. Make the iPhone a great capture tool</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying out this new app <em>Quick Capture</em>. Quick gives you a quick way to jot down a quick note either by hand, photo or verbally. Think of it like <em>Drafts</em>, but it supports dictation.</p>

<p>For me, the most reliable way to achieve <em>flow state</em> is to throw in the

</ul>
<p>I have much higher quality headphones than the Airpods, but some combination of the noise cancellation, weightlessness, and the lack of a cable makes a huge difference in helping me focus on what I need to get done. I do find it odd that I can either listen to calm, quiet music or aggressive dubstep and they both enable the same thing, but they do. I find listening to unfamiliar music with forward lyrics difficult for <em>concentration</em>. The noise cancellation is also helpful because I find the constant fan noise of the

<a
  href="/Vimium/"
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link"
  data-src="/Vimium/">Vimium</a>. The issue is that every app you use has to support VIM movements to make the payoff worthwhile. There are tools like <em>kindaVim</em> that try to bring a VIM experience to MacOS, but it still doesn&rsquo;t feel fully baked. We&rsquo;re most of the way there, but you can&rsquo;t use VIM commands in URL fields or to navigate within Electron apps and it&rsquo;s just too painful to have these superpowers and to only be able to use them 80% of the time. Not to mention, I worry a bit about betting my entire ability to work my computer on one app that intends to be paid. It seems like a great way to get held ransom in the future.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure at this point you&rsquo;re like &ldquo;Brandon, if you&rsquo;re so against VIM what are you going to use instead?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m going to use my keyboard, just remapped a bit. The key thing I find myself hating about my current keyboard setup that I have tried to fix with VIM is rapid navigation and selection. I feel like I&rsquo;ve gotten most of the way there by borrowing a handful of navigation commands from <em>Jason Rudolph</em>&rsquo;s 

<a target=“_blank” href="https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard" rel="noopener">Keyboard</a>
which I call 





<a
  href="/Super-Duper-Keyboard/"

  data-src="/Super-Duper-Keyboard/">Super Duper Keyboard</a>. It allows me to get Command, Option, Shift and all the arrow keys without having to leave the home row. Yes, this isn&rsquo;t all the power of VIM, but it gets me the parts that I feel I use constantly and I&rsquo;m confident that they work everywhere because it just uses native MacOS cursor navigation just with the convenience of being on the home row.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, as of the time of this writing: I have only been using this for about two weeks, so it&rsquo;s not fully in muscle memory yet, but it feels surprisingly natural.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cursor Movement without leaving the home row</li>
<li>Move a Word forward and back</li>
<li>Move to end of line, beginning of line</li>
<li>Selection with each of them</li>
<li>Lastly, delete a word forward or back (I currently have it on the default of alt+h and alt+l, but I&rsquo;m considering moving those to hyper+h and hyper+l)</li>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been there, that was the exact same situation I was in when I considered publishing my vault. Call me cheap, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I was ready to pay $20 a month for the rest of time. Would I keep writing meaningful content, would people actually ready it?

<p>NOTE: The easiest way to publish your vault online is by using 

<a target=“_blank” href="https://obsidian.md/publish" rel="noopener">Obsidian Publish</a>. I put a bunch of time into figuring out how all of this would work together, and I probably could have saved a bunch of time by just using Obsidian Publish. Either way, I&rsquo;ve learned a ton in setting this up. I also have more control on what does and doesn&rsquo;t get published. I have a ton of private content in my vault and I do not want that being published, which is why I went to all this trouble you&rsquo;re about to see. Yes, I could use multiple vaults, but that seems annoying when you want to link to something that resides in another vault.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking about publishing your 





<a

  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a> Vault online, but you&rsquo;re not sure if you want to pay for <em>Obsidian Publish</em> or not. I&rsquo;ve been there, that was the exact same situation I was in when I considered publishing my vault. Call me cheap, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was ready to pay $20 a month for the rest of time. Would I keep writing meaningful content, would people actually ready it? So instead, I decided I was going to figure out a way to publish my vault without the monthly fee. I now publish my vault online, and I don&rsquo;t pay anything for hosting. <strong>(You are currently reading this article from the digital vault that I publish through this method)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For me, I cobbled together a combination of:
<ul>
<li>

<a target=“_blank” href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz" rel="noopener"><strong>Quartz</strong></a>
<ul>
<li>A nice, clean-looking template for your digital garden that sits on top of <em>Hugo</em>. Once you get your bearings with it, you will find that it is just a <em>Hugo</em> site and you can customize it a ton if you would like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>

<a target=“_blank” href="https://github.com/brandonkboswell/obsidian-export/tree/title_frontmatter" rel="noopener">Obsidian Export</a></strong> (Slightly Modified)
<ul>
<li>A Rust based library for converting your Obsidian Vault to standards compliant <em>Markdown</em> that supports translating Obsidian style links to standard links that are compatible with Hugo.</li>
<li>Quartz and Hugo both assume that all of your files have a title attribute in their frontmatter. Unfortunately, most of my files do not have this title front matter. I have a branch of obsidian-export (linked above) that uses the file&rsquo;s name to generate titles when that frontmatter is not present.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>

<a target=“_blank” href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian" rel="noopener">obsidian-hugo</a></strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Quartz</em> has an easy setup that allows you to commit all of your content to <em>Github</em> and it will compile everything via <em>Github Actions</em>. This is fantastic and super helpful. The issue is I have private content that I don&rsquo;t want on Github.</li>
<li>So instead I use the <em>obsidian-hugo</em> library that Quartz&rsquo;s Github Action uses just I use it on my local machine and precompile the filtered content before uploading to Github. This enables me to host my Digital Garden on Github (for free) without risking private content accidentally leaking out onto the internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<a target=“_blank” href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart" rel="noopener"><strong>Github Pages</strong></a>
<ul>
<li>This is where I publish the content that gets output. It&rsquo;s all static html and is being served by Github. There is no amount of traffic I could ever manage to generate that Github couldn&rsquo;t handle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-do-i-use-obsidian-export-when-obsidian-hugo-is-required-by-quartz-and-does-most-of-the-same-things">Why do I use Obsidian Export when Obsidian Hugo is required by Quartz and does most of the same things?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>obsidian-export</strong> does a very good job of filtering out files and folders you don&rsquo;t want exported</li>
<li>it makes me confident that there is no chance that private data gets uploaded by not even allowing that data to be in the folder that gets parsed</li>
<li>It handles bad or no frontmatter so that the downstream pipeline doesn&rsquo;t have any issues</li>
<li>You can avoid a bunch of hacks to Quartz (and your layout files) by ensuring that your files have title attributes in their frontmatter. I have hacked together a fork of obsidian-export that does this automatically based on the file name when exporting.

<h1 id="high-level-steps-these-are-from-memory-as-i-set-this-up-a-few-months-ago">High Level Steps (these are from memory as I set this up a few months ago)</h1>
<ol>
<li>Clone 

<a target=“_blank” href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz" rel="noopener">Quartz</a> into a local directory</li>
<li>Create a Repo on Github to host your public garden
<ol>
<li>

<li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>Make the public folder of your Quartz repo a submodule of that repo
<ol>
<li><code>git submodule add &lt;your_github_project_url&gt; ./public</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Install Hugo for minifying and running a local server
<ol>
<li><code>brew install hugo</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Clone obsidian-export wherever you keep libraries
<ol>
<li>Obsidian Export runs in <em>Rust</em>, so make sure you have Rust enabled on your machine</li>
<li>If I remember correctly, I ran <code>cargo build</code> from the obsidian-export directory to build a local binary that can be called in the compile script</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Clone obsidian-hugo wherever you keep libraries
<ol>
<li>Obsidian-hugo runs in <em>Go</em>, so make sure you have Go enabled on your machine and in your PATH;</li>
<li>The watch/compile script will run <code>go run ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian -input=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/content -output=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz/assets/indices -index -root=/Users/brandonkboswell/Sites/quartz;</code> when it compiles.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Update the compile and watch scripts for the paths of your folders
<ol>
<li>My quartz directory is at: ~/Sites/quartz</li>
<li>My Obsidian Vault is at (My <em>iCloud</em> Folder): ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/bkb</li>
<li>My hugo-obsidian directory is at: ~/Sites/hugo-obsidian</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Configure your configuration files
<ol>
<li><strong>Hugo Config</strong> — quartz/config.toml file</li>
<li><strong>Quartz Config</strong> — data/config.yaml</li>
<li><strong>Quartz Graph Config</strong> — data/graphConfig.yaml</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add a file name <strong>.export-ignore</strong> to your Obsidian Vault
<ol>
<li>Obsidian Export will skip any files / folders you mention here and make sure they don&rsquo;t get handed to Quartz</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t create this file in Obsidian (you likely want to use the finder or a Code Editor).</li>
<li>A sample of my .export-ignore file is further down in this article</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Run the watch script (which will do an initial compile and then watch for changes to your Obsidian Vault)
<ol>
<li>Note that the compile script empties out your quartz/content directory so that files that may have been moved or deleted from your Obsidian Vault do not end up being pushed to the public internet. <strong>Make sure that this path is set correctly before running the watch or compile script.</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Start a hugo server from your quartz directory
<ol>
<li><code>./serve.sh</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Assuming everything worked, you should be able to preview your vault at: localhost:1313</li>
<li>Tinker / tweak for way too long</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re ready you can commit your quartz/public directory to Github pages
<ol>
<li><strong>Verify <em>(especially for the first commit)</em> that there is nothing private that you don&rsquo;t want uploaded to the internet.</strong></li>
<li><code>cd ~/Sites/quartz/public; git add .; git commit -m &quot;Update&quot;; git push origin</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>You probably want to do your ignoring of personal files at the obsidian-export level because if a file is referenced in another file, but that file is flagged as a draft in the frontmatter then hugo-obsidian will have trouble with that and make hugo error on compile with the backlinks. Doing your ignoring of specific files in obsidian-export takes care of this.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve never used <em>Hugo</em> before (like I hadn&rsquo;t prior to this project), you may not know that Hugo has a static folder that generates assets you want to be in any subsequent rebuilds. When I first started this project I added a bunch of lines to the compile script to create files and moving files around when all I really needed to do was add those files to my static folder.</li>
<li>You are going to want to update your Hugo layout files to take advantage of the backlink rendering provided by Obsidian Export. The changes you&rsquo;ll want to make, plus an explanation are available here:

<li>Originally I modified hugo-obsidian to get around the no titles issue, since I now do this in obsidian-export I no longer need to maintain a fork of that code. If it&rsquo;s useful to you, here is the change I made:
<ul>
<li>I had to make a minor modification to obsidian-hugo because it assumes that all of your files have a title attribute in their frontmatter. Unfortunately, most of my files do not have this title front matter. I have a branch of obsidian-hugo that uses the file&rsquo;s name to generate titles if that frontmatter is not present.

<li><strong>Hyper Key</strong>
<ul>
<li>This gives me an extra set of Keyboard Shortcut triggers without having to develop Carpel Tunnel or having to leave my home row. I used to bind many keyboard shortcuts to CTRL+ALT+COMMAND, but then I would have to leave the home row with the right hand which just leads to typing mistakes when trying to migrate back afterwards. Having the hyper key allows me to do those same shortcuts with my pinky finger on my left hand.
<ul>
<li>CAPS_LOCK to HYPER (SHIFT+COMMAND+OPTION+CONTROL) or ESCAPE (If Alone)</li>
<li>Hyper + i/j/k/l == vim directional Keys</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>HJKL Arrow Keys</strong>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the one above. I used to have one of the old Macbook Pros with the inverted T Arrow keys, and then with the unibody Macbooks with no ports they decided to screw that up. I had a ton of muscle memory for getting to those keys and never could get that back since they changed this. So last year I decided that I was going to move my arrow keys to the home row so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to leave it. This configuration also has Hyper + G for beginning of line and Hyper + ; for end of line, but I honestly never use those.  I just use Hyper+Command+H or L, there&rsquo;s too much muscle memory there that I can&rsquo;t seem to give up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shift+Escape to Tilde</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is largely just a symptom of having a 65% keyboard and needing to type a tilde where there&rsquo;s no key for it. This is what I chose. I have more 65% keyboard hacks in my Keyboard itself that I should probably do a video on. Let me know in the comments if you have any interest in that.</li>

You start from scratch, there are 1000&amp;rsquo;s of plugins to chose from, and honestly it all becomes one big distraction from actually generating thoughts and ideas. In this video, I will share my approach to managing an Obsidian vault in hopes it will save you a few headaches when starting from scratch.
Note: I publish my Obsidian Vault using Github Pages and because of this I use more folders than most vaults you will see. Having folders that I can hide away makes making sure I only share what I intend to share with the Internet.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Setting up your

<ul>
<li>1-1
<ul>
<li><em>I thoroughly enjoy writing in Obsidian, so I put my 1-1 notes with people I chat with on a regular basis instead of putting them in another app</em></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s just a running log with a date and the todos associated with that session</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business
<ul>
<li>A random assortment of notes that I want to keep and link to, but I don&rsquo;t want shared with the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collections
<ul>
<li>Where I collect items I thought were interesting that I want to be able to refer back to, but I might not actually have significant commentary on. Please let me know how you do this in the comments, that way I do this is not ideal. Basically I screenshot or get the URL for whatever it is and then Quick Add to

  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a> for storage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cooking
<ul>
<li>My wife is a far better cook then I, but I do cook a few meals each week. The issue I always found was I would do a meal and then by the time I cook that meal the next time I couldn&rsquo;t remember what I had tried, so I end up making the same mistakes and not progressing at perfecting the dish. So I started creating cooking notes for these and after each time I cook a dish I put another entry into that note. When I go to start cooking that dish again I refer back to what I had written the last time on what to try next.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideas
<ul>
<li>A random assortment of ideas. These are mostly a folder just to make them private when publishing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People
<ul>
<li>My notes on people. This one is also private as it has a bunch of people who didn&rsquo;t ask to be published online.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal
<ul>
<li>Pictures of cards, notes people have sent me or deeply personal writing prompts that don&rsquo;t need to be public</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Projects
<ul>
<li>A folder where all of the Youtube Videos or Articles start while I&rsquo;m figuring them out. Currently this folder is not published, but I might make it public soon and then just apply a draft tag to things that shouldn&rsquo;t be published. For instance the script for this video is in there</li>
</ul>
