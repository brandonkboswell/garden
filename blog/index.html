I call those Shower Thoughts. Have you ever wondered why you get these epiphanies in the shower? Well, there are a number of scientific reasons why, but let&rsquo;s focus on just one of them today, Boredom. When you&rsquo;re in the shower, you don&rsquo;t have your TV, computer, phone. (If I&rsquo;m being honest, I sometimes I have my phone, but I don&rsquo;t recommend that). Because you don&rsquo;t have these things you&rsquo;re forced to be one with your thoughts, and from a dopamine perspective they can be pretty boring in comparison to those devices, but Boredom breeds creativity....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/The-Case-For-Boredom/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Braggadocio-and-the-Modern-Web/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>Braggadocio and the Modern Web</h3><p class=margin-bottom>October 10, 2023</p><p>This is not a particularly new idea, but I was feeling it this morning, so I decided to write about it. In the modern internet, social media and collective culture, arrogance is rewarded with more attention, and in this case more clicks. There is little space for &ldquo;this is how I do things&rdquo; in hopes of someone sharing alternative approaches that perhaps you didn&rsquo;t know about or had not stuck for you. Instead, &ldquo;The Ultimate Guide to X&rdquo; is rewarded, even if it&rsquo;s not the Ultimate Guide at all.
I suppose bravado and arrogance has always been rewarded in sales, but I still wonder why that&rsquo;s the case....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Braggadocio-and-the-Modern-Web/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Which-e-Ink-device-would-I-not-buy/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>Which e-Ink device would I not buy?</h3><p class=margin-bottom>September 24, 2023</p><p>A prompt from a recent E-Ink Roundtable was: If you no longer had access to any of your E-Ink tablets, and had to go out and buy one with your own money, which would you not buy?

My use-case is one that rewards focus and creativity. My primary goal is to have a digital sketching and note-taking space that enables me to effortless share what I&rsquo;m sketching in real-time or immediately afterwards with my team.

When you&rsquo;re working on a new idea and the possibilities are still endless, the linear flow of modern digital tools is a recipe to build something like the things you&rsquo;ve already built or someone else has already built. Starting with digital also increases the risk of missing the point of the project altogether by working in high fidelity before you&rsquo;ve truly figured out the essence of what you&rsquo;re trying to make.

Instead of brute forcing a project over a single session or two, work on aspects of it over a handful of smaller work sessions across a few days. This enables you to have multiple fresh looks at the project (and your work on it), and I find that it leads to better overall quality.
I find in design, you can no longer see your work clearly after spending too much time with it. You need to leave it, do something else and re-evaluate it with &ldquo;fresh eyes&rdquo;....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Staccato-Method/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/The-Broad-Asynchronous-Reach-of-YouTube/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>The Broad, Asynchronous Reach of YouTube</h3><p class=margin-bottom>November 14, 2022</p><p>I have been creating videos on YouTube for a little over a year now. It started as a little experiment in sharing my favorite tips and tricks with the world, but has slowly grown much bigger than I originally expected. I recently took a look at my YouTube stats, and they are by no means staggering, but when you try to translate them into &ldquo;in-person&rdquo; or human terms it is quite wild.
Over the last 28 days here are some raw statistics from YouTube:
2,284 Subscribers 85,000 Views 55,300 Viewers 6,500 watch hours Let&rsquo;s translate those numbers into terms we can more easily wrap our heads around: 2,284 people have watched a video and at the end decided they would like to see more videos like that in the future....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/The-Broad-Asynchronous-Reach-of-YouTube/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/reMarkable-3-Beta-First-Impressions/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>reMarkable 3 Beta First Impressions</h3><p class=margin-bottom>October 28, 2022</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been using the reMarkable 3.0 Beta for the past week. Here are my initial impressions.
Being able to extend a page beyond A4 size is a huge improvement. Often I am forced to start a new page to continue a thought. Being able to have one page per ideas is very nice.
Being able to extend a page also opens up a better workflow to have one page per day. Previously, I couldn&rsquo;t fit my notes for a given day on one page, so I didn&rsquo;t attempt this. This works well now!
The ability to scroll pages is excellent, but I wish it remembered my scroll position when I leave the document and come back....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/reMarkable-3-Beta-First-Impressions/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Staying-up-late/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>Staying up late</h3><p class=margin-bottom>October 22, 2022</p><p>As someone who notoriously stays up late, I can finally say it is a bad tradeoff. For 8+ years, I have gone to bed after midnight. For a good portion of this time, I was going to bed around 2am. Only in the last year have I started going to bed reliably before midnight. Now I realize that staying up late (at least for me) is trading your fresh, creative hours in the morning for sluggish robotic hours in the evening. I was wasting my Most productive time of the day.
My ability to think creatively is significantly diminished in the evening, and staying up late to get a few more of those hours at the expense of a productive morning the next morning is just a bad deal....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Staying-up-late/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Should-you-upgrade-to-the-Second-Generation-AirPods-Pro/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>Should you upgrade to the Second Generation AirPods Pro?</h3><p class=margin-bottom>September 26, 2022</p><p>So you are a current AirPods Pro user, and you are trying to figure out if the new Second Generation AirPods Pro are worth the upgrade.

I think the PARA system is good and has merit, but no I don&rsquo;t think it is a great fit for Obsidian or your modern graph PKM systems because it is not flat enough.
