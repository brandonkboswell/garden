<p>I started using TickTick in march of this year after finding that time blocking in Things 3 + Fantastical to have a number of issues (perhaps I will do more on that in a future video).</p>
<p>Once I migrated over to TickTick, I found myself using it for everything. It basically became my inbox for everything: Tasks, Ideas, Funny things that people said that I didn&rsquo;t want to instantly forget. I came to the realization that as long as I could get the item into TickTick I would act on it.</p>
<p>The issue I found was although TickTick has good quick capture and dictation built in, there was no way they could do it fast enough for what I wanted. Mostly because of limitations in iOS. At least on my iPhone XS it can only boot so fast and it only can be ready for input so fast.</p>
<p>So I set out to see if I could create a quick capture that was instantly ready for input and that I could easily dictate to while in the shower or driving in the car.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where I landed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tap Quick Capture: to type in a quick task</li>
<li>I could tap the same for Dictate</li>
<li>If I&rsquo;m in another app and realize there&rsquo;s something I need to do late I can double tap the back of my phone to open the quick capture.</li>
<li>Lastly if I&rsquo;m in driving in the car or get an idea while in the shower I can say Hey Siri, Jot</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright so let me show you how to set this up:
Quick Capture</p>
<p>The Dictation Workflow</p>
<ul>
<li>New Shortcut</li>
<li>Choose a New: In this case Jot this Down</li>
<li>Choose Add Action
<ul>
<li>Search for Dictate Text</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Search for TickTick
<ul>
<li>Choose Add Single Task and Choose Dictated Text</li>
<li>Spin open the Options Arrow and be sure to Enable Edit in App. An interesting issue with Shortcut workflows is they don&rsquo;t open the app and the apps don&rsquo;t get a chance to send your newly created item to the cloud which means your newly created item only exists on your device which is exactly what we don&rsquo;t want. If you choose Edit in App then TickTick will open and your item will be available anywhere you access TickTick.</li>
<li>From here you can hit the share button at the bottom and choose Add to Home Screen
<ul>
<li>You can change the icon by tapping here on the left and you can change the App name here on the right. Choose add and you&rsquo;ve got a Quick Capture App you can launch from the Home Screen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright on to the Quick Capture Workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Same initial steps as before</p>
<ul>
<li>New Shortcut</li>
<li>Name it</li>
<li>Choose Add Action
<ul>
<li>Search for TickTick</li>
<li>Add a Single Task
<ul>
<li>Tap where it says task and choose Ask Each Time. Press Done on your keyboard</li>
<li>Spin open the arrow and enable edit in App</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lets give it a spin.</li>
<li>If it asks would you like to Allow Your shortcut to share data with TickTick then choose Allow</li>
<li>To make it launch on Double tapping the back of your phone:
<ul>
<li>Go to settings -> Accessibility -> Touch -> Back Tap ->. Double Tap and choose your Shortcut from the bottom of the list.</li>
<li>Now Double tapping the back of your iPhone will launch your quick capture shortcut.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There you have it. That&rsquo;s how I quick capture and dictate with TickTick for iOS. If this was helpful to you please leave a like and comment. Also I have a video on how I use Alfred to Quick launch anything. You can check it out right here.</p>

</ul>
