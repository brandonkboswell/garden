<h3 id=quick-capture>Quick Capture</h3>
<p>I get ideas & inspiration often while working on others and TickTick&rsquo;s quick capture allows me to quickly jot that down and get back to what I was doing without missing a beat.
* From iOS
* From MacOS
* From Chrome</p>
<h3 id=the-inbox>The Inbox</h3>
<p>My digital note list. This is where I cull through all the things & set follow up timing and lists for.</p>
<p>Reference Seth Godin&rsquo;s work around a system over outcomes. You have control over showing up, you have less control over the outcome, but if you create a system where you produce consistently and are constantly working on improving, you will be doing what you can.</p>
<h3 id=my-lists>My Lists</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are they:
<ul>
<li>Strategic Work vs Junk Work</li>
<li>Routines</li>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Evening</li>
<li>Personal Development</li>
<li>Youtube
<ul>
<li>Youtube Channel</li>
<li>Youtube Video Ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Productivity Blog</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Store</li>
<li>Content Backlog</li>
<li>Ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=routines>Routines</h3>
<p>Prior to embracing a digital todo list, I was a very reactionary person. Things didn&rsquo;t get done until I noticed they were needed. For example in my twenties I wouldn&rsquo;t go and get a haircut until I realized that my hair was way too long. In my mid twenties I finally realized the value of pre-scheduling haircuts and how I didn&rsquo;t have to look like a bum between haircuts.
Once I figured this out I could apply this same pattern to other things in life. Cutting the dog&rsquo;s nails, changing air filters in the house, getting the car inspected, etc.
Setting up repeats when creating routines.</p>
<h3 id=calendar-view--time-blocking>Calendar View / Time Blocking</h3>
<ul>
<li>How I do my timeblocking and make sure that my plan for the day makes sense. In a perfect world I would review this each night in preparation for the next day, but I typically review this with my morning cup of coffee before work.</li>
<li>Time blocking, including thinking time. Articles. Anything I want to get done. There is a much greater chance that you will follow through on your thinking time if you put it on a calendar. I used to do this in Fantastical, but I found that if I had to move that time for whatever reason (it happened a lot) that I would get phantom notifications and it quickly got the point that I was hating <em>Fantastical</em>. I worked with their support team, but ultimately it sounds like a limitation in how their push notification implementation with iOS and it wasn&rsquo;t fixable. So I solved this by moving my <em>Timeblocking</em> to TickTick as it could represent my Google Calendars similarly to Fantastical. (It does have a less than desirable quirk where declined meetings will continue to show). TickTick I&rsquo;ve reported this (please fix it).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id=pros>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Has Calendar Support that Things 3 was (intentionally) missing which made timeboxing and aligning with meeting schedules challenging</li>
<li>Really good support for attachments
(this was legitimately the thing that made me leave Things 3)</li>
<li>Syncing between multiple devices
<ul>
<li>Native + Web</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Excellent Quick Capture</li>
<li>Foldered Lists are pretty useful</li>
<li>Free Tier will likely work for many people</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id=cons>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Template support exists, but is a bit clunky</li>
<li>Invites you decline still show up in TickTick. This is especially painful for weekly recurring meetings. (Fix this TickTick)</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t move calendar events the way you can tasks, so you still need to use another calendar app such as Fantastical or Google Cal</li>
<li>Calendar view is more readable in the Browser than on the Mac App
<ul>
<li>The difference used to be huge, now it&rsquo;s just minor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
