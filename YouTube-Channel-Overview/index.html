<h3 id=pitch>Pitch</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I spend a lot of time with my computer, but I love it. I think part of why I love it is that I&rsquo;ve learned enough tricks along the way that I have for the most part gotten my computer out of the way of my thought process. [It&rsquo;s basically an extension of me at this point.] I want other people to enjoy the time they spend with their devices as much as I do. That&rsquo;s why I created a Youtube Channel where I chronicle my workflow experiments. What worked, what didn&rsquo;t and the tricks I&rsquo;ve learned along the way&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id=why-me>Why Me?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve always been someone who was good with computers</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m an engineer who knows deeply how computers function and can translate that understanding into easily understandable concepts</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve worked from home for the past 8 years and it has been incredibly rewarding for me, put my learnings from the past 8 years to use in your life.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m constantly experimenting and trying new things and keeping what works. Try out what I have been refining over the last 10+ years and see if it works for you.</li>
<li>I literally use a computer or iDevice most waking hours of my life. If it is good enough for me, it is likely good enough for you.</li>
