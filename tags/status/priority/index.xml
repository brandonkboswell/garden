Weekly planning is going well, but I think I am packing my days a bit too tight, as usually at least one thing slips each day. I have also noticed that my afternoon productivity is not nearly as strong as my morning. This is not completely surprising, but blocking in my day makes it more obvious.</p>
<p><em>2022-04-30</em>
This past week, with the introduction of 





<a
  
  rel="noopener" class="internal-link broken"
  data-src="Akiflow">Akiflow</a> to my workflow, I have noticed the benefit of weekly planning. Prior to the sprint starting, I looked at my tasks in Akiflow and my tickets for the sprint and slotted out time for all the tasks I planned to take on this sprint. I marked each as a <em>Daily Highlight</em> and they stand out on the calendar compared to the other tasks. It is so much easier to start a day with your <em>Daily Highlight</em> already selected. Of course if something else become more important I can tweak what my highlight is, but it is comforting to have a plan.</p>
<p>Do your planning at the beginning of the week. Review the morning of and then put the blinders on with Day View.</p>

<p>Even a simple plan like this will eliminate dozens of redundant decisions for me over the next week.

<p>Cancelled on <em>2022-04-25</em>. Had signed up for a year subscription to try it out. Turns out I found it incredibly annoying, and I&rsquo;ve instead adopted the principle to set a 5-minute timer to remind myself to get off of whatever app I was on. That was the piece I really enjoyed, and it can be accomplished with a simple Shortcut flow on iOS (similar to what the app uses).</p>
<p>All in all, it was worth it because it showed me how useful that notification can be and how to use app launching intercepts to do interesting actions on iOS.</p>
