To add structure, however, I began numbering my journal entries. My idea was that the numbering would continue from one volume to the next, rather than restart. That way, I could index my journal based on entry numbers instead of volume/page number. It also meant I could refer to previous entries by their number.

Early on in my ideation, when the idea is still unclear and rough, Analog tools afford me a freer form of expression. Later as things become more clear, I switch to Digital Tools for higher fidelity, refinement, storage, and communication.
If I don’t have a general direction of where I want to go with an idea/design, then I don’t have any business in a high fidelity digital tool (Ex: Figma, Code).
This reminds me of a story from The Revenge of Analog where Antonio Marazza spoke about a design firm adopting Photoshop and their designs suffered until they forced their designers to ideate in Moleskine notebooks for the first week of a project before they were allowed to use Photoshop....</p></div><p class="meta margin-top"><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/Start-with-Analog-Tools/>Read More</a></p></a></div><a href=https://brandonkboswell.com/if-a-note-or-quote-isnt-worth-writing-by-hand-its-not-worth-keeping/ class=page-list__page><div class=section><div class=desc><h3>if a note or quote isn’t worth writing by hand it’s not worth keeping</h3><p class=margin-bottom>June 4, 2022</p><p>Cool idea from Curtis McHale
Before Sax dives into the sections he also wants to make the point that going digital only or analogue only is a false choice. You can mix and match the two mediums as needed.

And vice versa, objects that are farther apart are perceived as different groups. In typographic design, &ldquo;proximity&rdquo; refers to the amount of whitespace created by line height, margin, and padding. There should be a distinctive and noticeable amount of additional whitespace between two different sections. Consider the following example: Tactically, Headers should not have even top and bottom margin. They should hug their child paragraph and distance themselves from the previous paragraph.

Julian mentions there are five novelty categories:
Counter-intuitive — &ldquo;Oh, I never realized the world worked that way.&rdquo; Counter-narrative — &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s not how I was told the world worked!&rdquo; Shock and awe — &ldquo;That&rsquo;s crazy.
