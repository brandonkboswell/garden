<p>My 2003 Dodge Dakota doesn&rsquo;t connect to my phone and has a pretty terrible sound system. Hell, it doesn&rsquo;t even have cabin air filters (Although I wish it did), but I often find that I get these Shower Thoughts here as well (because I&rsquo;m left alone with my thoughts).

The digital nature of our lives makes it easy to add something to the list – yet never act upon it.

Instead, we should move these tasks to some form of a <em>Someday Backlog</em> and then revisit that with an appropriate frequency. Perhaps once a quarter or twice a year. It will feel good to see how many of those tasks you actually took care or are no longer relevant.</p>
