My initial impression was that the video serves a great foundation and example to prove to people that links and folders can coexist in a PKM system.

<p>I found that I landed on a very similar system between in my use of 





<a

  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a> and 





<a

  data-src="/Obsidian/">Obsidian</a> (You can watch that video 

<a target=“_blank” href="https://youtu.be/ND-HvY6TwF4" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t currently have multiple spaces in my 





<a

<a

  data-src="/Notion/">Notion</a>), but I could see that being a good fit for people who do want/need to maintain work notes in their vault.</p>
<p>Overall, I would say check out the ACCESS method and grab the parts of it that make sense and work for you.</p>

One thing I believe to be true is that our <em>metabolism</em> slows as we age. I believe this to be a factor in why most people get heavier as they get old. In thinking about that, I think it might be worthwhile to increase my number of workouts each week from 1 to 2. One was previously all that was necessary to meet my health and fitness goals, but as I grow older, this will likely not be enough.</p>

<p>The video recommends a <em>Dopamine Detox</em> where on a certain day you avoid all sources of dopamine in hopes of lowering your required thresholds.</p>
<p>In the video, he recommends linking your low-dopamine activities that you need to do to push you forward with the high dopamine activities as a reward for completing them. This is similar to what I did after reading
