<p>In thinking about this, I think it may be dependent on how niche your audience is. If you have truly unique and differentiated content and your audience is niche, then you may be better off paywalling it.</p>
<p>I think the counter-argument here is you still need a monetization strategy of some kind.</p>

<p><strong>Bit of a random question but regarding the &lsquo;people&rsquo; folder what sort of information do you put into files for your contacts (i.e. the people you know, not authors)?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out! There isn&rsquo;t a ton of structure to the people notes aside from some automation to create an alias to the person&rsquo;s first name, which is handy when referencing a person in my daily notes. In my case, I keep the notes for people I know and authors I read in the same folder. They are real people, after all, and some of the people whose content I consume I also end up connecting with virtually. Many of the notes are empty, but some have important information about the person that I don&rsquo;t want to forget. Most importantly, they are landing places where I can look at the local graph to see all the interactions or times I have mentioned those people in my <em>Daily Notes</em> or
