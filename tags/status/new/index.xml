<p>Just writing a few sentences from that moment can bring you right back to that moment on a future date.</p>

<hr>
<p>It is difficult to solve a problem you can&rsquo;t describe. Take the time to write out the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve to validate that you truly understand what you&rsquo;re trying to solve. This is especially helpful when <em>scoping</em> a problem.
