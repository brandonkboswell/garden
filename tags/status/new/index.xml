<ul>
<li>Great casters</li>
<li>Excellent lower back support</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t push my shoulders forward. This was the reason I had to get rid of the <em>Secret Labs Omega</em></li>
<li>Very comfortable for Desk work. This is a very good fit with the contour

  data-src="/Fully-Jarvis-Desk">Fully Jarvis Desk</a> I use.</li>
<li>The armrests don&rsquo;t both me nearly as much as other people have noted, but I&rsquo;m also not a big armrest user.</li>
<li>The sync fabric is great and a significant upgrade over the previous Balance &amp; Rhythm fabrics.</li>
<li>The front of the chair is very creaky where the depth adjustment is.
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to get some white lithium grease tomorrow and grease it. A guide for this is available 

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hermanmiller/comments/l0aw9w/steps_to_fix_embody_chair_creaking/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf" rel="noopener">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2022-04-05</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I greased the seat depth adjustment as outlined in the guide above and after letting it work in for a bit the squeaking is gone.</li>
<li>It also seemed like pulling one side out a little further until it clicked made a big difference. Basically, when you think you&rsquo;ve got it even on both sides, pull one side out until it clicks again.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2022-04-06</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like I have gotten the seat adjusted like I want it now.</li>
<li>I have some back fatigue when I sit in it for long periods of time, but I believe that is largely due to the chair forcing my lumbar into the correct position, and I need to build up strength in new areas to support that. The fatigue is not great and honestly my back feels excellent when I wake up each morning. I&rsquo;m hopeful that it will subside in the coming days. Aside from that, I am absolutely loving the chair. The upper back support and my posture seem improved.</li>

<hr>
<p>It is difficult to solve a problem you can&rsquo;t describe. Take the time to write out the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve to validate that you truly understand what you&rsquo;re trying to solve. This is especially helpful when <em>scoping</em> a problem.
