<p>Being intimately familiar with something enables us to be playful with it, to modify it, to spot new and different ideas without running the risk of merely repeating old ideas believing they are new.

<ul>
<li>Great casters</li>
<li>Excellent lower back support</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t push my shoulders forward. This was the reason I had to get rid of the <em>Secret Labs Omega</em></li>
<li>Very comfortable for Desk work. This is a very good fit with the contour 





<a
  href="/Fully-Jarvis-Desk"

  data-src="/Fully-Jarvis-Desk">Fully Jarvis Desk</a> I use.</li>
<li>The armrests don&rsquo;t both me nearly as much as other people have noted, but I&rsquo;m also not a big armrest user.</li>
<li>The sync fabric is great and a significant upgrade over the previous Balance &amp; Rhythm fabrics.</li>
<li>The front of the chair is very creaky where the depth adjustment is.
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to get some white lithium grease tomorrow and grease it. A guide for this is available 

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hermanmiller/comments/l0aw9w/steps_to_fix_embody_chair_creaking/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf" rel="noopener">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2022-04-05</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I greased the seat depth adjustment as outlined in the guide above and after letting it work in for a bit the squeaking is gone.</li>
<li>It also seemed like pulling one side out a little further until it clicked made a big difference. Basically, when you think you&rsquo;ve got it even on both sides, pull one side out until it clicks again.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2022-04-06</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like I have gotten the seat adjusted like I want it now.</li>
<li>I have some back fatigue when I sit in it for long periods of time, but I believe that is largely due to the chair forcing my lumbar into the correct position, and I need to build up strength in new areas to support that. The fatigue is not great and honestly my back feels excellent when I wake up each morning. I&rsquo;m hopeful that it will subside in the coming days. Aside from that, I am absolutely loving the chair. The upper back support and my posture seem improved.</li>

<hr>
<p>It is difficult to solve a problem you can&rsquo;t describe. Take the time to write out the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve to validate that you truly understand what you&rsquo;re trying to solve. This is especially helpful when <em>scoping</em> a problem.
