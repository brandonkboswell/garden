There has been a weird phenomenon since I got the Loftie. Each night I have gone to bed before 11 and each morning I have gotten up with or before the Loftie has gone off. I think this has more to do with me getting good sleep than the Loftie itself, but it has been an odd experience. We also had Mother&rsquo;s Day over the weekend which makes for a different dynamic than usual. I should get more representative data this week.</p>
<p><em>2022-05-07</em>
This was my first real day with the Loftie. I got up on time, but this might not be purely due to the alarm clock. I had two drinks last night during the movie and fell asleep fairly early. More testing necessary. 😃</p>
<p><em>2022-05-06</em>
This was my first morning with the alarm clock, but I had a unique schedule this morning with having to drop the truck off for an inspection</p>
