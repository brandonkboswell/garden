<p>I think this machine got a bad rap when it came out for only having USB-C ports. I actually think that aspect of the computer is fine and that criticism is a bit harsh. What I can&rsquo;t look past and I feel make it a dreadful device are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the constant fan noise</li>
<li>clunky handling of external displays</li>
<li>awful key travel</li>
<li>horrible arrow key shape that no longer allows your fingers to find them reliably without looking</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>I have much higher quality headphones than the Airpods, but some combination of the noise cancellation, weightlessness, and the lack of a cable makes a huge difference in helping me focus on what I need to get done. I do find it odd that I can either listen to calm, quiet music or aggressive dubstep and they both enable the same thing, but they do. I find listening to unfamiliar music with forward lyrics difficult for <em>concentration</em>. The noise cancellation is also helpful because I find the constant fan noise of the

<p>Businesses are good at measuring performance, but bad at measuring trustworthiness.
The Navy Seals think of people in a Performance vs Trust matrix. Ideally you want the high performance, high trust individual, but if you can&rsquo;t have that person you should value high trust over high performing. The high performing, low trust person is toxic to your team. Medium performance individuals can be taught.</p>
