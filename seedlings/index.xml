To be completely clear, I have not personally tried an ultrawide monitor, but I would think screensharing and moving windows around would be annoying on one.

A key thing that kept me from breaking the addiction earlier was the social time I got gaming with my cousin. He and I would play almost every night and that was a major portion of my social interaction. If I was going to stop gaming into the early morning hours each night, I would need to find additional ways to get that social interaction.</p>
<p>I decided to start digital gardening and producing a YouTube channel instead. I still game, but limit it to one or two nights a week.</p>
